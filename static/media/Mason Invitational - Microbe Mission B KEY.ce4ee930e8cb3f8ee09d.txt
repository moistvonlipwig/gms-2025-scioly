Now that you have determined the shape of this mysterious bacteria, you still need more information in order to uncover its
identity. You realize that the next best step to take is to perform a Gram Stain.
5. In order to begin performing your gram stain, you must first fix your mysterious bacteria to the slide in order to make sure that
it does not get rinsed off during the procedure. This can be done by 2 main mechanisms: Chemical Fixation and Heat Fixation.
Describe 1 advantage that Chemical Fixation has on Heat Fixation. [1]
-
Overheating bacterial cells may cause their shapes to be distorted leading to observation mistakes
-
Chemical Fixation is better at preserving the cell morphology
-
Heating can result in the destruction of intracellular integrity

Delicate samples with fragile structures are at risk of during heat fixation
-
etc.

notice that none of the bacteria under the microscope appear pink. From the list of remaining possible bacteria, which bacteria
can you determine is not the mystery bacteria? [1]

distinguished by the Gram Stain. Additionally, state what staining procedure can be used to accurately reveal the identification of
one of the remaining bacteria? [4]

You discover a cell line capable of undergoing all major metabolic pathways in animal cells. Four mutants of this cell line
are known, with each mutant producing only one defective protein. You isolate each mutant (1-4) and grow them on a

the relative levels of ATP production by the cell. Protein solution consisted of various amino acids, carbohydrate solution
consisted of various sugars, and fat solution consisted of triglycerides. In further experiments, you discover that when an

production levels while a “-” indicates low ATP production levels. [5] Which of the following is TRUE about your

You review some preliminary work that Neil has done (poorly). He has done a fluctuation Ames test with the strong mutagen
benzo[a]pyrene as a positive control (Row A) and epsom salt as the negative control (Row H) and no additives in Row G. Then
in rows B-F he tested increasing concentration of a Mystery Compound. In columns 1-4 a tester strain for single nucleotide
polymorphisms was tested. In Columns 5-8 a tester for frameshifts was tested. In Columns 9-12 a special strain (Strain X) was
added that produces large amounts of bicarbonate (a buffer) as a respiratory product instead of CO2 when unmutated but is
not auxotrophic. The pH indicator in each well changes from purple to yellow when acid is introduced into the environment.
All wells have media that does not contain histidine and was inoculated with the strains as indicated above. Assume all
mutagenesis is 100% effective for controls. The figure below shows his results.
