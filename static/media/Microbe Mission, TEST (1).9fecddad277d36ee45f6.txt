Read the following case report:
A 30-year-old pre-school teacher comes into the doctor's office. She reports that she has been
having extreme fatigue and nausea. Additionally, she has been having frequent diarrhea, loose
stools, and has experienced bloating and rapid weight loss. She remembers having previously
eaten 12 containers of yogurt before her symptoms began (they were buy-one-get-one free, she
couldn't resist), having met with a friend visiting from abroad, and having a few children with
similar symptoms in her class.
Based on your knowledge and the information provided, answer the following questions:
7. What disorder does the patient have?
8. What microbe causes this disorder?
9. What may have caused the patient to contract this disorder?
10. Write and number the steps of performing a gram stain.
11. What will be the difference between the gram negative and gram positive bacteria after
the procedure?
Questions 12-16 will provide images of different microbes. For each, name the microbe and the
disease it causes.

Questions 30 and 31 use the image and the information provided below
Shown here in 'A' a zebrafish larva, a common model for bacterial infections. The area
circled in white is the otic vesicle, or the zebrafish ear. Assume that the zebrafish ear is a
perfect sphere with a volume of 1Ã—105 cubic microns.
30. If a zebrafish researcher wanted to fill the zebrafish otic vesicle completely with
Streptococcus pneumoniae, how many bacteria should be injected into the ear, assuming

--- Page 8 ---
that a single S. pneumoniae bacterium is 2 micron in diameter? Give your answer in
scientific notation.
