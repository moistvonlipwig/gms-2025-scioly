 MICROBE MISSION - SAMPLE TOURNAMENT #1 
 
 
 
  
 
by Karen L. Lancour 
 
 
 
STATION A: MICROSCOPY  
 
 
   1. A microscope has an 10 objective and oculars of 4X, 10X, 40X and 
       100X.   What is the range of magnification for this microscope.   (lowest to highest) 
 
 
  2. A student prepares a slide with the letters "GR" and positions it on the stage in the  
normal reading position.  When viewed, how will the "GR " will appear?   
Draw it on your answer sheet. 
 
  
  3. Examine the diagram of the stage with the millimeter ruler from a 10X objective.  
      What is the diameter of this field of view in millimeters?  in micrometers or mcm?   
 
 
  4. What would be the diameter of the 40X field of view based upon diameter of the 10X  
      objective from question # 5 in millimeters?        in micrometers or mcm?  
      (Remember: it must be calculated using the information from 
       question # 4 and the ratio of magnification because it is less than one mm) 
 
 
 
  5. Examine the Photo of Spirogyra.  Assume that the length of the photo is the same 
      as the diameter of the 40X field of view calculated in question 5, what is the length 
      of the of a cell in micrometers or mcm?
