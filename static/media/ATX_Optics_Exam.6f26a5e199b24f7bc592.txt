University of Texas at Austin 2024 Invitational
Optics B/C Exam
Directions:
• This is a class set, DO NOT WRITE
• Write all answers on the answer sheets; any marks elsewhere will not be scored. If additional
space is needed on a question, clearly mark the question number and your team
number on the top left of the page and attach to your test.
• There is no penalty for wrong answers. Answer as many questions as possible, even if you
aren’t sure if you’re correct. For questions with parts that build on one another, points will
be awarded for correct answers on parts regardless of previous part completion.
• Units are required whenever giving a numerical answer. Don’t worry about significant figures.
• Good luck on the test!
