Read the following case report:
A 30-year-old pre-school teacher comes into the doctor's office. She reports that she has been
having extreme fatigue and nausea. Additionally, she has been having frequent diarrhea, loose
stools, and has experienced bloating and rapid weight loss. She remembers having previously
eaten 12 containers of yogurt before her symptoms began (they were buy-one-get-one free, she
couldn't resist), having met with a friend visiting from abroad, and having a few children with
similar symptoms in her class.
Based on your knowledge and the information provided, answer the following questions:
7. What disorder does the patient have?
giardia
8. What microbe causes this disorder?
giardia duodenalis
9. What may have caused the patient to contract this disorder?
working at the pre-school puts the teacher in contact with students who may have
been sick with giardia; the friend visiting from abroad may have also exposed her to
the disease; one of the containers of yogurt she ate could have been handled by
someone with the disorder.
10. Write and number the steps of performing a gram stain.
1. apply a primary stain (crystal violet) and rinse with water.
2. add a mordant (gram’s iodine) and incubate.
3. rapid decolorization with ethanol, acetone or a mixture of both and rinse with
water.
4. counterstain with safranin and rinse with water.
11. What will be the difference between the gram negative and gram positive bacteria after

The diagram below corresponds to questions 37-41:
37. From left to right, list the proper terminologies for each colored section of the graph,
separating each response with a comma.
lag phase, log/exponential growth phase, stationary phase, death/logarithmic decline
phase

--- Page 11 ---
38. What is happening in the first phase of the diagram and why does the graph appear the
way it does?
the bacteria are adapting to their growth conditions, increasing in size, synthesizing
proteins, enzymes, and rna, and repairing damage. the graph appears flat because
they have not yet begun dividing.
39. What is happening in the second phase of the diagram and why does the graph appear the
way it does?
cells are dividing by binary fission and the doubling of each generation causes the
exponential growth seen.
40. What is happening in the third phase of the diagram and why does the graph appear the
way it does?
the rate of bacterial growth is equal to the rate of cell death, meaning that the
number of bacterial cells stops increasing. This is why we begin to see the graph
leveling out.
41. What is happening in the last phase of the diagram and why does the graph appear the
way it does?
waste slowly begins to build up and nutrient rich media is depleted, causing the cells
to stop their metabolic functions and begin dying, causing a downward trend in
bacterial growth.
42. List and describe the steps of lytic and lysogenic virus replication.
lytic replication:
1. attachment: the virus attaches to the host by binding to receptors on the host's
surface.
2. penetration: the virus injects its DNA into the host cell by puncturing a hole in the
cell membrane.
3. biosynthesis: the virus replicates its DNA and produces proteins.
4. maturation: the virus assembles around the phage genomes.
5. release: the mature virus bursts out of the host cell.
lysogenic replication:
1. the phage infects a cell.
2. the phage dna becomes incorporated into the host genome.
3. the cell divides and prophage dna is passed on to daughter cells.
4. under stressful conditions, the prophage dna is excised from the bacterial
chromosome and enters the lytic cycle.
5. phage dna replicates and phage proteins are made.
