FRQ (5pts each, award partial credit based on how thorough their explanations are, below are some
sample explanations):
1.
Fiber optics utilize the principle of total internal reflection to transmit light signals through thin
strands of glass or plastic. Total internal reflection occurs when light traveling in a medium with
a higher refractive index encounters a boundary with a lower refractive index at an angle greater
than the critical angle. Applications include telecommunications, medical imaging, and data
transmission.
2.
A convex lens is thicker at the center than at the edges. It converges parallel rays of light to a
focal point. The distance between the lens and the focal point is the focal length. For objects
beyond the focal point, real and inverted images are formed. As objects move closer, the image
becomes virtual, upright, and magnified.
3.
Chromatic aberration occurs due to the dispersion of light into its component colors. It results in
color fringing in images. This can be minimized by using achromatic lenses that combine multiple
lens elements to focus different colors at the same point, reducing the effect of dispersion.
4.
Polarization refers to the orientation of light waves. Natural sources include sunlight reflecting
off surfaces. Artificial sources include polaroid filters. Polarizing filters are used to reduce glare,
enhance contrast, and improve visibility in certain conditions, such as photography or
sunglasses.

5.
A concave mirror is curved inward and forms real, inverted images. Applications include shaving
mirrors, satellite dishes, and reflectors in headlights. The focal point is located in front of the
mirror. Image size depends on the object's distance from the mirror.
6.
Diffraction is the bending of light waves around obstacles or through openings. It's noticeable
when the size of the opening is comparable to the wavelength of light. Examples include the
spreading of light around door edges or the interference pattern produced by a narrow slit.
7.
The camera aperture controls the amount of light entering the camera. A wider aperture (smaller
f-number) allows more light, affecting exposure. However, it also impacts depth of field.
Choosing the right aperture involves a trade-off between exposure and depth of field.
8.
Dispersion is the separation of white light into its component colors. A prism accomplishes this
by refracting different colors by different amounts. The order of colors in the spectrum is red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV).
9.
Optical power measures a lens's ability to converge or diverge light. It is measured in diopters.
Converging lenses have positive power, while diverging lenses have negative power. The
formula for optical power (P) is P = 1/f, where f is the focal length in meters.
10. A convex lens is used to correct hypermetropia by converging incoming light before it reaches
the retina. This compensates for the short focal length of the hypermetropic eye. The corrected
lens allows the eye to focus on near objects more effectively.

g. Draw the four corners first as points along the connection between each corner to the
sphere’s center, then fill in the edges to the best of your intuition. Make sure no point is
further than halfway between the sphere’s surface and center. The front and back edges
should also curve outwards, getting closer to the sphere’s surface when approaching the
horizontal axis. (7pts)
