(5 pts) 66. This picture is showing an Algal Bloom.  An algal bloom is a result of an 
abundance of nutrients, especially phosphorus.  Because of the excess nutrients the algae 
increase their population dramatically. Each alga is short-lived, and the result is a high 
concentration of dead organic matter which starts to decay. The decay process consumes 
dissolved oxygen in the water, resulting in hypoxic conditions. Without sufficient dissolved 
oxygen in the water, animals and plants may die off in large numbers. 
 
 
 
 
 
(3 pts) 67.  This is an example of the Streak Technique. In microbiology, Streaking is a 
technique used to isolate a pure strain from a single species of microorganism, often 
bacteria. Samples can then be taken from the resulting colonies and a microbiological culture 
can be grown on a new plate so that the organism can be identified, studied, or tested.

Staphylococcus 
 
 
(4 pts) 70. Euglena.  Euglena is a unicellular flagellate protist.  They are autotrophic microbes 
containing chloroplast however they can also take in nutrition heterotrophically.  The Euglena 
has a red eyespot that detects light, permitting it to move in the direction of the light source.
