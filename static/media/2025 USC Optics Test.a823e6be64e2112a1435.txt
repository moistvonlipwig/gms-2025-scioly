Optics B TEST
Directions:
• You will have 50 minutes to complete this test along with the lab portion of the event.
• All electronic devices, except up to two stand-alone calculators, must be put away.
• If work is shown for FRQs, partial credit may be awarded for incorrect answers.
• Round answers reasonably. No deductions will be made for incorrect significant figures,
but they may used for tiebreaking.
• Use SI units unless specifically stated otherwise.
• Useful constant: c = 3.00 × 108 m/s
• Any provided diagrams may not be to scale unless specified.
• For ray-tracing questions, full credit will be awarded for at least 2 rays per lens/mirror
and all objects and images correctly drawn. The diagram does not need to be to scale,
but must roughly show the locations of objects and images in relation to lenses/mirrors

tant is used in a moving environment.

22. How can the index error of a sextant be cor-
rected?
A. By measuring the angle between two
distant objects multiple times and av-
eraging the results.
B. By recalibrating the sextant using a
standard angular reference tool.

C. 35.71◦
D. 38.04◦
24. Say you try to hit the fish with a spear, aiming
directly at the fish. Will you hit it?
A. No, because light refracts at the water
surface, making the fish appear higher
than it actually is.
B. Yes, because the light travels straight
through the water without bending.
C. No, because water magnifies the fish,
making it appear larger and closer.
D. Yes, because the apparent position of
the fish matches its real position.

tive color model?

27. Why does a yellow piece of paper look yellow un-
der white light?
A. The paper absorbs blue light and re-
flects red and green light, which com-
bine to appear yellow.
B. The paper absorbs red and green light
and reflects blue light, giving it a yellow
appearance.
C. The paper emits yellow light when illu-
minated by white light.
D. The paper absorbs all other colors ex-
cept yellow, which it reflects.
28. How does changing the focal length of a camera
lens affect the image?

the subject and narrows the field of
view.
B. Increasing the focal length reduces the
subject size and broadens the field of
view.
C. Decreasing the focal length magnifies
the subject and narrows the field of
view.
D. Decreasing the focal length has no ef-
fect on the magnification or field of
view.
29. Why are compound microscopes typically used
instead of simple microscopes for high magnifica-
tions?
A. Compound microscopes combine the
magnification of two lenses, allowing
for greater total magnification.
B. Compound
microscopes
use
larger
lenses, which produce higher magnifi-
cations than smaller lenses.
C. Compound
microscopes
reduce
the
amount of light needed for high mag-
nification.
D. Compound microscopes require less
alignment, making them easier to use
for high magnifications.
