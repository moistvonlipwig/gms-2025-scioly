Reflection and Refraction (18 points)
1) In around one sentence, describe the main difference between specular and diffuse
reflection. (2 points)

--- Page 3 ---
Specular reflection is reflection where the reflected rays are all parallel to
each other, whereas diffuse reflection is reflection where the reflected rays all
travel in random directions.
2) When a beam of light travels from a medium of higher index of refraction to a medium of
lower index of refraction, does the angle of refraction increase or decrease? Briefly use
mathematics to show how/why this is the case. (4 points)
Increases
Snell’s law: n₁*sin θ₁=n₂*sin θ₂, simple rearranging or explanation of how
ratios of indices of refraction on either side of the equation compare
3) If a beam of light is moving from a medium of higher index of refraction to a medium of
lower index of refraction, at what minimum angle, in degrees, will the beam of light need
to hit the surface between the two mediums in order to remain trapped inside the first
medium? You may leave your answer as an expression. (2 points)
θ = inverse sin n₂/n₁
4) Perform a simple mathematical derivation for the equation used to solve the previous
question. (4 points)
Applying Snell’s Law to calculate the critical angle:
n₁*sin θ₁ = n₂ * sin 90
n₁* sin θ₁ = n₂ * 1
sin θ₁ = n₂/n₁
sin θ₁ = sin(critical angle)
θ₁ = inverse sin n₂/n₁
Where n₁>n₂
