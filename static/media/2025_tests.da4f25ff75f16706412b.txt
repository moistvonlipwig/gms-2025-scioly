+0.5pt for each correct ray (up to +2) for partial credit. This means you get +1pt for correctly
tracing the first intermediate image.
(c) (4 points) Is the resulting image real or virtual? Where is the resulting image?
Solution:
+1pt: Virtual
AND
+3pt for location: 14 cm behind the original lens (or equivalent)
OR
+1pt for correctly applying the lens equation the first time with object distance 2.5 cm and
focal length 10 cm
+1pt for correctly setting up the lens equation the second time with object distance 2.5 + 3.33
cm and focal length 10 cm
(d) (2 points) What is the magnification of this lens system?
Solution:
+2pt for answer: 3.2
OR +1pt for getting magnification of first lens: 3.33/2.5 = 1.33
2. (2 points) The “infrared window” is a window of wavelengths between 8 and 14 microns (refer to figure
??) in the Earth’s atmosphere that is crucial in regulating its temperatures and preventing warming.
Why?
Solution:
+1pt: Atmosphere transmits a lot of this radiation outwards, as evidenced by the spectrum
+1pt: Infrared light contributes to a lot of the heating of earth, so allowing it to escape in controlled
amounts has a large impact on the earth’s temperature
3. (4 points) A light ray enters a prism with an apex angle of 60◦and a refractive index of 1.6. The angle
of incidence is 40◦. If the ray emerges symmetrically, calculate the angle of deviation.
Solution:
+1pt: Correctly sets up the problem, identifying r1 = r2 = A
2 due to symmetry, and using Snell’s
law sin i = n sin r1 to calculate r1.
+1pt: Applies Snell’s law correctly to calculate sin r1 = sin 40◦
1.6
and determines r1.
+1pt: Uses the deviation formula δ = 2i −A and substitutes the correct values (i = 40◦, A = 60◦).
+1pt: Correctly calculates the angle of deviation as δ = 20◦.
4. (2 points) Provide one example each of an everyday item that uses additive and subtractive color theory.
Solution:

Subtractive Color Theory (1 point possible):
• Example: Color printers, paint mixing, or film photography that use cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black (CMYK) pigments to produce colors.
5. (2 points) Hypothetically, a shirt that appeared to be blue under white light had a red light shone upon
it. What color would the shirt appear to be now, and why?
Solution:
+1pt: Correctly states that the shirt would appear black or dark.
+1pt: Explains that the shirt reflects blue light under white light, but under red light, there are no
blue wavelengths to reflect, so the shirt absorbs the red light and appears black.
6. (3 points) Describe the role of the aperture, lens, and sensor in a camera.
Solution:
+1pt: The aperture controls the amount of light entering the camera by adjusting its size. A larger
aperture allows more light in, while a smaller aperture reduces the amount of light.
+1pt: The lens focuses light onto the camera sensor by bending and directing the light rays to form
a sharp image.
+1pt: The sensor captures the incoming light and converts it into an electronic signal, creating the
digital image.
7. (3 points) What type of telescope is a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope? Why is it popular among ama-
teur astronomers? (3 points: 1 point for identifying the type of telescope, 2 points for explaining its
popularity.)
Solution:
+1pt: A Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope is a type of catadioptric telescope that combines mirrors and
lenses in its design.
+2pt: It is popular among amateur astronomers because it combines the long focal length of a
refracting telescope with the lower cost per aperture of a reflecting telescope.
Its compact and
portable design makes it easy to transport and ideal for its given aperture, adding to its appeal for
amateurs.
8. (5 points) Advanced optical designs like the Ritchey–Chr´etien telescope are commonly used in profes-
sional astronomy.
Describe the design of a Ritchey–Chr´etien telescope, including its unique optical
elements and the advantages it provides over simpler designs. Why is it particularly suitable for as-
trophotography and large observatories? (5 points)
Solution:
+2pt: The Ritchey–Chr´etien telescope is a type of reflecting telescope that uses a hyperbolic pri-
mary mirror and a hyperbolic secondary mirror. This combination eliminates coma and spherical
aberration, providing sharp images across a wide field of view.

+1pt: Unlike simpler designs, it does not require a corrector plate and has no chromatic aberration,
making it ideal for professional applications.
+1pt: Its wide field of view and ability to produce diffraction-limited images make it particularly

Section 3
Write out a short response to the following questions
1. (4 points) How does the vector form of the law of reflection apply to anisotropic materials
where the surface properties change with direction?
Answer: The law of reflection can be adjusted to consider anisotropic materials by incor-
porating the directional dependence of surface properties, which leads to different reflection
behaviors based on the material’s orientation. In anisotropic materials, surface properties
such as the refractive index can vary depending on the direction of light. [2] The vector
form of the law of reflection still holds, but it requires modification to account for the
variation in reflection depending on the direction. This means that the angle of reflection
is no longer uniform across the surface, as it is influenced by the anisotropic nature of the
material. [2]
2. (4 points) How does the Abbe number affect the dispersion of light in a prism? Calculate the
chromatic aberration for a prism made of crown glass with an Abbe number of 60 when light
enters at an angle of 45°.
Answer: The Abbe number is a measure of how much dispersion (the spreading of light
into its component colors) a material exhibits. A higher Abbe number indicates lower
dispersion, meaning that the material causes less chromatic aberration. [2] For crown glass
with an Abbe number of 60, the dispersion is relatively low. Chromatic aberration can be
calculated by examining the difference in the refractive index of the material for different
wavelengths of light. When light enters the prism at an angle of 45°, the dispersion across
wavelengths leads to slight differences in how each color bends, resulting in chromatic
aberration. [2]
3. (4 points) Explore how additive color theory is applied in modern display technology (e.g.,
OLED) and compare it with subtractive color theory in high-quality printing.
Answer: Additive color theory is used in modern display technologies such as OLED
screens. In this theory, colors are created by combining different intensities of red, green,
and blue (RGB) light. When these colors are mixed together in varying proportions, they
can produce almost any color. For example, combining all three in equal intensity results
in white light. [2] In contrast, subtractive color theory is used in high-quality printing.
This theory involves mixing pigments that absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect
others.
The primary colors in subtractive color theory are cyan, magenta, and yellow
(CMY), and mixing these pigments results in the absorption of more light, thus producing
darker colors. When all three pigments are combined, they ideally absorb all light and
create black. [2]
4. (4 points) Calculate the reflectance for light at normal incidence on a metal surface, given its
complex refractive index. Discuss how this affects the perception of color for different metals
(e.g., gold, silver).
Page 6 of 17

--- Page 7 ---
Answer: The reflectance for light at normal incidence on a metal surface can be calcu-
lated using the Fresnel equations, which take into account the material’s complex refractive
index. This complex refractive index includes both the real part, representing how light
slows down in the material, and the imaginary part, representing how much light is ab-
sorbed by the material. [2] The amount of light reflected at the surface affects how we
perceive the color of metals. For instance, gold appears yellow because it reflects red and
yellow wavelengths more efficiently while absorbing blue and green. Silver, on the other
hand, reflects nearly all wavelengths of visible light, giving it its shiny, white appearance.
[2]
5. (4 points) Explain how spherical aberration affects vision and how the eye naturally compen-
sates for this. Discuss the limitations of this compensation in aging populations.
Answer: Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through the periphery of a
lens (such as the eye’s lens) are focused at different points than light rays passing through
the center, causing a blurred image. This effect leads to a decrease in image sharpness. [2]
The eye compensates for spherical aberration naturally by constricting the pupil, which
reduces the amount of light entering through the periphery and allows more focused central
rays to dominate. However, as individuals age, the ability to constrict the pupil diminishes,
and the eye’s lens becomes less flexible, reducing the effectiveness of this compensation
and leading to more pronounced visual distortions. [2]
6. (4 points) Model how the arrangement of photoreceptors in the retina can create blind spots
and why our brains typically don’t notice these spots in normal vision.
Answer: The arrangement of photoreceptors in the retina creates a natural blind spot
at the location where the optic nerve exits the eye because there are no photoreceptors
(rods or cones) in that region. [2] Despite this blind spot, the brain uses information
from the other eye and surrounding visual data to ”fill in” the gap, making the blind
spot essentially unnoticeable in normal vision.
This process is part of how the brain
compensates for missing visual information to create a seamless visual experience. [2]
7. (4 points) Explain how the lensmaker’s equation can be modified to account for spherical
aberration in high-precision optical systems.
Answer: The lensmaker’s equation, which is typically used to calculate the focal length of
a lens based on its curvature and refractive index, can be modified to account for spherical
aberration by including higher-order terms that correct for the varying focal lengths of
peripheral rays versus central rays. [2] In high-precision optical systems, spherical aber-
ration is reduced by altering the lens shape to aspheric profiles, which can help focus all
incoming rays at a single point, regardless of their position on the lens. [1] Additionally,
multi-element lens systems can be designed to counteract aberrations, where different lens
surfaces work together to eliminate distortion. [1]
8. (4 points) Explain the Rayleigh scattering polarization effect in the context of the Earth’s
atmosphere. How does the degree of polarization vary with the angle of observation?
Page 7 of 17

--- Page 8 ---
Answer: Rayleigh scattering occurs when sunlight interacts with the small gas molecules
in Earth’s atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue) more than
longer wavelengths. This scattering effect causes the sky to appear blue. [1] The polar-
ization of light increases as a result of Rayleigh scattering because light waves oscillate
in a specific direction when scattered, which leads to partial polarization of the scattered
light. [1] The degree of polarization depends on the angle of observation: it is maximized
at a 90-degree angle from the sun (perpendicular to the light source) and decreases when
looking directly toward or away from the sun. [2]
9. (4 points) Derive the threshold condition for laser action in terms of population inversion and
discuss the impact of cavity design on laser coherence length.
Answer: For laser action to occur, the population inversion must reach a threshold where
the number of atoms in an excited state exceeds the number in the ground state, en-
abling stimulated emission to dominate over absorption. This threshold condition can be
expressed as a gain coefficient exceeding the losses in the laser cavity. [2] The design of
the cavity affects the coherence length of the laser, with longer cavities generally leading
to longer coherence lengths. This is because the cavity supports fewer modes, allowing
for more coherent light emission. [1] Additionally, mirror reflectivity at the ends of the
cavity influences the coherence length; highly reflective mirrors help maintain coherence
over longer distances. [1]
10. (4 points) Explore how femtosecond lasers can be used in LASIK surgery to correct aberrations
in the human eye. Include a discussion of wavefront-guided techniques.
Answer: Femtosecond lasers are used in LASIK surgery to create precise, controlled
corneal flaps with minimal damage to surrounding tissues.
The extremely short pulse
duration of the femtosecond laser allows for highly accurate cuts, reducing the risk of
complications and improving the healing process. [2] In addition to reshaping the cornea,
femtosecond lasers are employed in wavefront-guided LASIK, which maps the unique im-
perfections (or higher-order aberrations) of a patient’s eye. [1] These aberrations are then
corrected with customized laser ablation, providing improved visual outcomes compared
to traditional LASIK techniques. [1]
11. (4 points) Explain the role of laser diffraction in reading information stored in CD/DVD
media, and discuss how error correction algorithms help in compensating for optical imperfec-
tions.
Answer: Laser diffraction is key in reading information stored in CD/DVD media. A
laser beam is focused onto the disc surface, and the reflected light is diffracted by the pits
and lands encoded on the disc. These differences in reflection are interpreted as binary
data, which the reading system converts into digital information. [2] Due to imperfections
on the disc’s surface, such as scratches or dust, the readout may not be perfect. Error
correction algorithms, such as Reed-Solomon coding, are used to detect and correct small
errors in the data by adding redundancy and error-checking mechanisms to the encoded

information, ensuring accurate data retrieval even in the presence of optical imperfections.

Section 4
Write out your work and answer to the following questions
1. (4 points) A beam of light enters a prism with a refractive index of 1.6 at an angle of 30◦.
Calculate the angle of refraction, to the nearest hundredth of a degree, inside the prism.
Answer:
Using Snell’s law, we have:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
where n1 = 1 (for air), θ1 = 30◦, and n2 = 1.6 (for the prism). Solving for θ2:
1 × sin 30◦= 1.6 × sin θ2
sin θ2 = sin 30◦
1.6
= 0.5
1.6 = 0.3125
θ2 = sin−1(0.3125) ≈18.21◦
Thus, the angle of refraction inside the prism is approximately 18.21◦.
2. (4 points) A plano-convex lens has a radius of curvature of 20 cm. Calculate the focal length,
to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, of the lens if it is made of glass with a refractive index of
1.5.
Answer:
The focal length of a plano-convex lens is given by the lensmaker’s equation:
1
f = (n −1)
 1
R1
−1
R2

For a plano-convex lens, R1 = 20 cm and R2 = ∞(because one surface is flat). The
refractive index n = 1.5. Substituting into the equation:
1
f = (1.5 −1)
 1
20 −1
∞

1
f = 0.5 × 1
20 = 0.5
20 = 0.025
f =
1
0.025 = 40 cm
Thus, the focal length of the lens is 40.0 cm .
3. (4 points) Calculate the total internal reflection angle, to the nearest hundredth of a degree,
for light moving from water (n = 1.33) to air.
Page 10 of 17

--- Page 11 ---
Answer:
The critical angle for total internal reflection can be calculated using the
formula:
sin θc = n2
n1
where n1 = 1.33 (for water) and n2 = 1 (for air). Solving for θc:
sin θc =
1
1.33 = 0.7519
θc = sin−1(0.7519) ≈48.75◦
Thus, the total internal reflection angle is approximately 48.75◦.
4. (4 points) A converging lens has a focal length of 20 cm. An object is placed 30 cm from the
lens. Calculate the position relative to the lens, to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, and the
nature (real or virtual, magnified or diminished) of the image.
Answer:
Using the lens formula:
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
where f = 20 cm (focal length) and do = 30 cm (object distance). Solving for di (image
distance):
1
di
= 1
f −1
do
= 1
20 −1
30 = 3 −2
60
= 1
60
di = 60 cm
Since the image distance is positive, the image is real. To determine the magnification
(M):
M = −di
do
= −60
30 = −2
The negative magnification indicates that the image is inverted. Therefore, the image is
real, inverted, and magnified by a factor of 2. Thus, the image is located 60.0 cm from
the lens, and it is real and magnified.
5. (4 points) A beam of light passes through a double slit, with slit separation of 0.5 mm, and
produces an interference pattern on a screen placed 1.5 meters away. If the wavelength of light
is 600 nm, calculate the distance, to the nearest tenth of a millimeter, between the central
bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe.
Answer:
The distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe
can be calculated using the formula for double-slit interference:
y = mλL
d
Page 11 of 17

--- Page 12 ---
where: - m = 1 (for the first-order fringe), - λ = 600 nm = 600 × 10−9 m (wavelength of
light), - L = 1.5 m (distance to the screen), - d = 0.5 mm = 0.5 × 10−3 m (slit separation).
Substituting the values:
y = 1 × 600 × 10−9 × 1.5
0.5 × 10−3
= 900 × 10−9
0.5 × 10−3 = 1.8 × 10−3 m = 1.8 mm
Thus, the distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe is
approximately 1.8 mm .
6. (4 points) Light of wavelength 500 nm passes through a diffraction grating with 104 lines per
centimeter. Calculate the angle, to the nearest hundredth of a degree, where the second-order
maximum occurs.
Answer:
The angle of the second-order maximum can be found using the diffraction
grating formula:
d sin θ = mλ
where: - m = 2 (second-order maximum), - λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10−9 m (wavelength of
light), - d =
1
104 lines/cm =
1
106 lines/m = 10−6 m (grating spacing).
Substituting the values:
10−6 sin θ = 2 × 500 × 10−9
sin θ = 1000 × 10−9
10−6
= 1
Since sin θ = 1, θ = 90◦.
Thus, the second-order maximum occurs at 90.00◦.
7. (4 points) A telescope’s objective lens has a focal length of 2 meters, and its eyepiece has
a focal length of 10 cm. Calculate the magnification produced by this telescope, assuming
normal adjustment.
Answer:
The magnification M of a telescope is given by the formula:
M = fobjective
feyepiece
where fobjective = 2 meters = 200 cm and feyepiece = 10 cm.
Substituting the values:
M = 200
10 = 20
Thus, the magnification produced by the telescope is 20 .
8. (4 points) A monochromatic light source has a wavelength of 400 nm in air. If the light enters
water, which has a refractive index of 1.33, calculate the new wavelength of the light in water,
to the nearest nanometer.
Page 12 of 17

--- Page 13 ---
Answer:
The wavelength of light in a medium is given by:
λmedium = λair
n
where λair = 400 nm and n = 1.33 (refractive index of water).
Substituting the values:
λmedium = 400
1.33 ≈300.75 nm
Rounding to the nearest nanometer, the new wavelength of the light in water is 301 nm .
9. (4 points) A concave lens has a focal length of −20 cm. If an object is placed 15 cm from the
lens, calculate the image distance, to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter, and describe the
nature (real or virtual, magnified or diminished) of the image.
Answer:
Using the lens formula:
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
where f = −20 cm and do = 15 cm. Solving for di (image distance):
1
di
= 1
f −1
do
=
1
−20 −1
15 = −3 −4
60
= −7
60
di = 60
−7 ≈−8.57 cm
The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual. Since the absolute value of di is less
than do, the image is also diminished. Thus, the image is located at −8.57 cm , and it is
virtual and diminished.
10. (4 points) A light ray traveling through glass (refractive index 1.5) strikes a glass-to-air bound-
ary at an angle of incidence of 40◦. Calculate the angle of refraction, to the nearest hundredth
of a degree, of the light as it passes into the air.
Answer:
Using Snell’s law:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
where n1 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass), θ1 = 40◦(angle of incidence), and n2 = 1
(refractive index of air). Solving for θ2 (angle of refraction):
1.5 × sin 40◦= 1 × sin θ2
sin θ2 = 1.5 × 0.6428 = 0.9642
θ2 = sin−1(0.9642) ≈74.62◦
Page 13 of 17

--- Page 14 ---
Thus, the angle of refraction is approximately 74.62◦.
11. (4 points) In a double-slit experiment, the distance between the slits is 0.13 mm, and the
distance to the screen is 1 meter. If the second-order bright fringe is observed at a position
12 mm away from the central maximum, calculate the wavelength of the light, to the nearest
nanometer.
Answer:
The position of the m-th order bright fringe in a double-slit experiment is given
by:
y = mλL
d
where:
• y = 12 mm = 12 × 10−3 m (position of the second-order bright fringe)
• m = 2 (second-order)
• L = 1 m (distance to the screen)
• d = 0.13 mm = 0.13 × 10−3 m (slit separation)
Substituting the values:
12 × 10−3 =
2 × λ × 1
0.13 × 10−3
λ = 12 × 10−3 × 0.13 × 10−3
2 × 1
= 780 × 10−9 m = 780 nm
Thus, the wavelength of the light is 780 nm .
12. (4 points) A certain telescope has an angular resolution of 1.22× λ
D, where λ is the wavelength
of light and D is the diameter of the objective lens. If the telescope’s objective lens has a
diameter of 1 meter and the wavelength of light is 500 nm, calculate the angular resolution to
the nearest thousandth of an arcsecond.
Answer:
The formula for angular resolution is:
θ = 1.22 × λ
D
where λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10−9 m and D = 1 m.
Substituting the values:
θ = 1.22 × 500 × 10−9
1
= 6.1 × 10−7 radians
To convert this to arcseconds, recall that 1 radian = 206, 265 arcseconds:
θ = 6.1 × 10−7 × 206, 265 ≈0.126 arcseconds
Page 14 of 17

--- Page 15 ---
Thus, the angular resolution is approximately 0.126 arcseconds .
13. (4 points) A laser emits light with a power of 2 mW and a wavelength of 650 nm. Calculate
the energy, in joules, of a single photon emitted by the laser.
Answer:
The energy of a single photon is given by the formula:
E = hc
λ
where: - h = 6.626 × 10−34 J · s (Planck’s constant), - c = 3.0 × 108 m/s (speed of light), -
λ = 650 nm = 650 × 10−9 m (wavelength of the laser light).
Substituting the values:
E = 6.626 × 10−34 × 3.0 × 108
650 × 10−9
= 1.9878 × 10−25
650 × 10−9
≈3.058 × 10−19 J
Thus, the energy of a single photon is approximately 3.06 × 10−19 J .
14. (4 points) A concave mirror has a focal length of 12 cm. Calculate the magnification of the
image if the object is placed 8 cm from the mirror.
Answer:
First, we use the mirror equation to find the image distance:
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
where:
• f = 12 cm (focal length of the concave mirror)
• do = 8 cm (object distance)
Solving for di (image distance):
1
12 = 1
8 + 1
di
1
di
= 1
12 −1
8 = 2 −3
24
= −1
24
di = −24 cm
Now, the magnification M is given by:
M = −di
do
= −−24
8
= 3
Page 15 of 17

--- Page 16 ---
Thus, the magnification of the image is 3 , meaning the image is magnified and virtual
(since the image distance is negative).
15. (8 points) Prove that when light is incident at Brewster’s angle, the reflected light is completely
polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Hint: Start by using Fresnel’s equations and
prove that the reflection coefficient for light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence goes to
zero at Brewster’s angle.
Answer:
Brewster’s angle, denoted as θB, is the angle of incidence at which light, when
reflected from the boundary between two media, becomes fully polarized perpendicular to
the plane of incidence. The condition for Brewster’s angle is given by:
θB = tan−1
n2
n1

where:
• n1 is the refractive index of the first medium,
• n2 is the refractive index of the second medium.
At Brewster’s angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular, meaning:
θr + θt = 90◦
where θr is the reflection angle and θt is the refraction angle.
To describe the reflection and transmission of light at the boundary, we use Fresnel’s
equations for the reflection coefficients of parallel and perpendicular polarizations.
• For parallel-polarized light (r∥):
r∥= n2 cos θi −n1 cos θt
n2 cos θi + n1 cos θt
• For perpendicular-polarized light (r⊥):
r⊥= n1 cos θi −n2 cos θt
n1 cos θi + n2 cos θt
where:
• θi is the angle of incidence
• θt is the angle of refraction, related by Snell’s law: n1 sin θi = n2 sin θt
At Brewster’s angle, the reflected light is completely polarized perpendicular to the plane
of incidence. This implies that the reflection coefficient for the parallel component r∥must
be zero. Let’s prove that this is true.
Page 16 of 17

--- Page 17 ---
We know that at Brewster’s angle:
θr + θt = 90◦
⇒
θt = 90◦−θB
Using Snell’s law:
n1 sin θB = n2 sin θt = n2 cos θB
Substituting this into Fresnel’s equation for r∥:
r∥= n2 cos θB −n1 cos(90◦−θB)
n2 cos θB + n1 cos(90◦−θB)
Since cos(90◦−θB) = sin θB, we get:
r∥= n2 cos θB −n1 sin θB
n2 cos θB + n1 sin θB
At Brewster’s angle, tan θB = n2
n1, or equivalently, n1 tan θB = n2, which implies:
n1 sin θB = n2 cos θB
Substituting this into the equation for r∥:
r∥= n2 cos θB −n2 cos θB
n2 cos θB + n2 cos θB
= 0
Thus, at Brewster’s angle, the reflection coefficient for parallel-polarized light is zero,
meaning no parallel-polarized light is reflected.
Since r∥= 0 at Brewster’s angle, no light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence is
reflected. Therefore, the reflected light is fully polarized perpendicular to the plane of
incidence (s-polarized). ■

ANSWER KEY
Off-topic Light Trivia
1. (3 points) You shoot a laser in a vacuum.
a. What is the speed of that light (give the exact value)?
b. How could that be calculated from the permittivity and permeability of
free space?
c. The laser is not aimed at your eye. Can you still see the beam as it travels
through space? Why or why not?
1. (Answer)
a. The speed of light in a vacuum is defined to be c = 299 792 458 meters per
second.
b. This speed may be calculated by
q
1
ε0µ0, where ε0 and µ0 are the
permittivity and permeability of free space, respectively.
c. Contrary to Star Wars and other science fiction movies, you can not see a
beam of light in a vacuum with no particles to scatter light and redirect it
back to you. You might see the source of the light, and you might see it
after it reflects off something else, but not where the light is not
interacting with anything else. (Half credit is awarded for particles
scattering light.)
2. (4 points) Now, you shine a white laser.
a. Wait, what? Is a white laser even possible? Explain, via the internal
workings of a laser, why this is or is not feasible.
b. What does the color white mean in terms of the distribution of photon
frequencies?
c. What is the D65 definition of white light?
d. How is white light generated by a computer?
2. (Answer)

by exciting a bunch of atoms, which then emit a photon of a constant
wavelength when they drop back into the ground state. However, by

choosing a particular combination of atoms, it is possible to create an
effect that appears like white light, and indeed, white lasers have been
demonstrated.
b. White is not a spectral color, so the wave has a range of frequencies in a
continuum, not just one.
c. One definition of white light is the black-body radiation emitted at 6504
Kelvin, which closely approximates what we perceive as white.
d. White light in computers is generated by shining (roughly) equal
intensities of red, green, and blue light, which our eyes perceive as white.
3. (3 points) You have a lamp that emits light uniformly in all directions for

a. If you were instead two meters away from the wall but kept the lamp for a

What fraction of the lamps energy does each cube receive?
3. (Answer)
a.

22 = 3
4 = 75% percent of the energy reaches the wall.
b. The distance in the denominator must be squared because the energy
received follows an inverse-square law.
c. There are 6 walls, each receiving the same amount of energy, so each
wall receives a sixth of the energy.

Timanana’s Science Olympiad Summer Study Session 2023 Optics Key
ANSWER KEY
a. They can see light between 400 and 700 THz.
b. As light travels through the eye, it first hits the cornea, which refracts the
light and protects the eye. After that, light passes through the aqueous
humor, which also refracts to some degree. The light then goes through
the pupil, a black dot in the middle of our eyes. Following this, it is
refracted by the lens, passes through the vitreous humour (which
supports the retina), and hits the retina, which captures the light and
sends a signal to the brain using rods and cones, which are specialized
photoreceptor cells. Rods detect general light and are sensitive at low
levels of light, while cones detect color.
5. (2 points) You spray paint a white wall so that, when illuminated by white
light, it now appears red.
a. What is physically different about the wall that causes you to see the color
red?
b. If you instead illuminated the white wall with red light, the wall would still
appear red. How do the two ways of making the wall red differ?
5. (Answer)
a. Your action creates a layer of spray paint on top of the wall that only
reflects red light while absorbing all the other colors. Thus, only the color
red is visible to your eye.
b. On the other hand, your second action simply adds red light while
removing the white light, so you also only see red light reflected off the
wall.
6. (3 points) The sun illuminates a mist of suspended water droplets, and this

b. Is it possible for two rainbows to be formed?
c. Over there is a snake. It can eat you even in complete darkness because of
its pit organs, which can sense temperature. But it also likes rainbows.
When a snake looks at a rainbow, which color appears at the top of the
primary bow?
6. (Answer)

--- Page 5 ---
Timanana’s Science Olympiad Summer Study Session 2023 Optics Key
ANSWER KEY
a. Neither. The rainbow does not have a definite position. The rainbow light
originates from above and is refracted and reflected inside the droplets
themselves, and then shines toward you. However, the image appears to
originate from behind the water droplets, as that is where the rays of
rainbow light converge.
b. It is possible. Sometimes, two rainbows are seen because of light that
refracts or reflects more than once or is scattered (e.g., diffraction) in
some secondary process.
c. Infrared appears on the top because snakes see infrared (the question
tells you that they sense temperature, so they must therefore see in the
infrared).
7. (3 points) For movies in 3D, the projector shines two beams of light
intended to be viewed by different eyes. The two lenses in a pair of 3D glasses
determine which beam goes to which eye. Why might the glasses prefer
circular over linear polarization?
7. (Answer) 3D glasses attempt to serve different images into the two eyes,
and here, the screen creates two images, polarized in different modes, and
each glass only allows one mode through. If linear polarizers were used, then
simply tilting one’s head or leaning to the side might lead to the wrong
mode because linear polarization can take on an entire unit circle of values.
However, circular polarization only has two values, right and left-handed, so
there is more leeway in what a person can do with their glasses.

9. (Answer)
a. The phase shift is π radians. While the light does not experience a
change in phase from the path itself (the path length is a multiple of the
wavelength), it still does experience a reversal in phase when it reflects
off the mirror.
b. Let your reflection be point R. Then, if there was no mirror, all rays of light
previously reflecting off the mirror to you would instead hit point R. Thus,
we can draw lines from point R to the edges of the mirror, which
becomes the outline.

a. What phenomenon would that be called, and where does the light go?
b. How do we define smoothness in the first place?
(Bonus 5 points if you can derive the criterion.)
10. (Answer)
a. The angle of reflection would be 45◦by the law of reflection.
b.
a. This would be called diffuse reflection, and light would spread out
instead of staying in a beam.
b. Smoothness is defined by requiring that the mirror satisfy Rayleigh’s
Roughness Criterion h <
λ
8 cos θ, where h is the maximum height
difference between two points, λ is the incident light, and θ is the
angle of incidence.
• This is derived by finding the phase difference between two
reflected rays of light. If the phase difference of light in the
specularly reflected direction is less than π
2, then most of the light
constructively interferes.
• The phase difference is the extra distance traveled by one of the
rays. If the angle of incidence (and therefore the angle of reflection)
is γ, and the height difference is h, then the extra distance traveled
is ∆φ = 2h cos γ, which is found by drawing perpendiculars to the
paths of light and expressing the difference in path length with
trigonometry.
• After multiplying by the conversion factor, the phase difference
becomes k∆φ = 2kh cos γ, where k = 2π
λ is the wavenumber of the
wave.
• Solving for h leads to the above representation.

seen on the other side, assuming no other illumination, pure light, and a
thick enough glass?
b. Why are those assumptions necessary?
c. What about shining red light through the glass?
11. (Answer)
a. The only light seen would be green, as the blue light is filtered out.
b. These assumptions are necessary because, without them, some other
light would still be seen, tainting the color. Furthermore, not having thick
glass would mean that some light might still, against the odds, pass
through the glass.
c. However, shining red light through the glass would make it appear black
because no light passes through.

12. (Answer) The colors would disperse into a spectrum of spectral colors.
Red would be on the bottom because it has the lowest refractive indices of

Refraction
16. (3 points) You now shine at a block of glass. If you shine with some angle
θ above the horizontal, the light goes through the glass and refracts. After the
light comes out, what angle does it make to the normal?
16. (Answer) The angle is 90 −θ, because the refractive indices on the
medium (presumably air) on both sides of the glass are the same, and
anything inside does not matter. However, we now need to find the angle to
the normal, so we take the complement of θ.
17. (3 points) The glass is shaped into an isosceles triangular prism.
a. Define the angle of the prism and the angle of deviation in this context.
b. Why does the light bend upon entering the prism, and how would you
quantify the bending?
c. Given the angle of the prism and the angles of incidence and refraction at
the first point of incidence, how would you determine the second pair of
angles, the angle of deviation, and the ratio of the refractive indices?
17. (Answer) The angle of the prism is the angle at the top of the prism (e.g.,
assuming we have a two-dimensional triangular, the top angle). When light
passes through the prism, it bends twice, and the sum of this bending is the
angle of deviation.
Refraction is the bending of a wave as it is transmitted due to a change in
the electric and magnetic fields induced by oscillations of charged particles
in that new medium. The bending is determined by Snell’s Law, which states
that if light travels from a medium with a refractive index of n1 travels into n2,
and the angle of incidence is θ1, and the angle of refraction is θ2, then
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2.
Let the angle of the prism be A, the angle of deviation be d, and the ratio of
refractive indices (nprism
nair ) be n. Additionally, define the first pair of angles of
incidence and reflection to be θi1 and θr1, and the second pair to be θi2 and
θr2, respectively. By the equation sin θi1 = n sin θr1, we can find n. From the

--- Page 11 ---

ANSWER KEY
triangle formed by the two intersection points and the point with angle A,
we have A + (90 −θr1) + (90 −θi2) = 180, so θr1 = A −θi2. Thus, n sin θi2 = sin θr2,
and we can deduce that d = θi1 −θr1 + θr2 −θi2.
18. (3 points) The prism morphs into a biconcave lens with a focal length of
30 centimeters. An object is half a meter away from the pole of the lens and 10
centimeters above the axis.
a. What is the power of the lens in diopters? Answer to 20 significant figures.
b. Where is the image formed? What is its magnification? Is it real or virtual?
Is it upright or inverted?
c. How would you derive the thin lens and magnification equations through

f = 1
o + 1
i, so the distance to the image is 75
centimeters, a virtual image, implying it is also upright. Furthermore, by the
magnification equation, the image is 15 centimeters high.
Both are derived through similar right triangles, formed by a ray parallel to
the axis and the ray straight through the center of the pole of the lens. Let
the height of the object be ho, the height of the image be hi, the focal length
be f, the distance to the object be o, and the distance to the image be i. For
the magnification equation, we use ho (measured at the object) and o as one
triangle, and hi and i as the second triangle. For the thin lens equation, we
use ho (measured at the pole) and f (to the right of the lens) as one triangle,
and hi and i −f as the second triangle. Solving, we get the thin lens equation
too.
A biconcave lens will diverge light, allowing light in the eyes of a myopic
person (which converges in front of the retina) to focus farther back instead.

20. (3 points) A laser in one medium is shone at a second, transparent

n1.
b. Light only TIRs for certain media. So let’s say we have a medium, and
light currently TIRs into a second medium. Well, if we put a third medium
so that they exactly touch, and the third medium has a high enough
refractive index such that no TIR occurs, then the light will simply
transmit. So there’s an intermediate phase if the two media are only
slightly separated by a few wavelengths. Then, even though the light is
supposed to TIR because it first hits the low refractive index medium, it
can sense that there’s a third medium close by and still be transmitted.
This is like quantum tunneling, where a particle can sense that there is a
place of low potential just beyond a barrier and go through it. Indeed,
both involve exponential decay probabilities.

Than They Appear. What does it mean, and aside from in the rear-view

objects appear smaller and farther away — they smush the entire road
behind the vehicle into one small mirror image. Convex mirrors also appear
in security mirrors or near blind-turns so that people can see around corners.

a. (Answer) Obviously, a laser rangefinder requires batteries. The path of
light might also not reflect off the target or be deflected by some other
obstacle or wind or refraction. Furthermore, this does not take into account
the curvature of the Earth, where you can see the target from refraction, but
the target is actually over the horizon. Finally, the beam might spread out or
travel at different speeds if the medium is not a perfect vacuum.

Timanana’s Science Olympiad Summer Study Session 2023 Optics Key
ANSWER KEY
b. (Answer) The stadiametric rangefinder works by similar triangles. These
generally contain a series of markings in a hyperbolic shape (e.g., the
positive portion of the curve 1
x) with known radial distances from a baseline.
Then, given the height of a distant object, its distance may be determined by
how much radial distance it takes up. This device also works backward, e.g.,
finding a height based on an object’s distance.
c. (Answer) A stereoscopic rangefinder is composed of two eyepieces (e.g.,
with binoculars). They (lenses) are angled such that a point a certain
distance away will converge perfectly (when this convergent point is away
from the target, double images of the target will be seen). The angle is then
adjusted until there are no double images, and then the degree of rotation
will determine the distance.

28. (1 point) Is a true one-way mirror, which reflects light in one direction,
but transmits light in the other direction, impossible, without an external
energy source controlling the mirror? Why or why not?
28. (Answer) It is impossible. If the temperature on the transmitting side is
low, but the temperature on the reflecting side is high, then the cold side
would get even colder, while the hot side even hotter. This decreases the
entropy of the system. Since there is no external energy source to
compensate for this loss of entropy, this would violate the second law of
thermodynamics.

e. (Answer) First, we should think that the multiplicative effect of the later
filters should approach 1. While there are infinitely many of them, each only
attenuates a tiny fraction of incident light. Furthermore, by the paradox
itself, it is believable that the intensity should be a strictly increasing
function. But we can prove this with calculus too. Restating the double angle
formula, we have for any θ, that
cos2 θ = 1 + cos 2θ

,
so our function is equivalent to

FRQ (5pts each, award partial credit based on how thorough their explanations are, below are some
sample explanations):
1.
Fiber optics utilize the principle of total internal reflection to transmit light signals through thin
strands of glass or plastic. Total internal reflection occurs when light traveling in a medium with
a higher refractive index encounters a boundary with a lower refractive index at an angle greater
than the critical angle. Applications include telecommunications, medical imaging, and data
transmission.
2.
A convex lens is thicker at the center than at the edges. It converges parallel rays of light to a
focal point. The distance between the lens and the focal point is the focal length. For objects
beyond the focal point, real and inverted images are formed. As objects move closer, the image
becomes virtual, upright, and magnified.
3.
Chromatic aberration occurs due to the dispersion of light into its component colors. It results in
color fringing in images. This can be minimized by using achromatic lenses that combine multiple
lens elements to focus different colors at the same point, reducing the effect of dispersion.
4.
Polarization refers to the orientation of light waves. Natural sources include sunlight reflecting
off surfaces. Artificial sources include polaroid filters. Polarizing filters are used to reduce glare,
enhance contrast, and improve visibility in certain conditions, such as photography or
sunglasses.

--- Page 2 ---
5.
A concave mirror is curved inward and forms real, inverted images. Applications include shaving
mirrors, satellite dishes, and reflectors in headlights. The focal point is located in front of the
mirror. Image size depends on the object's distance from the mirror.
6.
Diffraction is the bending of light waves around obstacles or through openings. It's noticeable
when the size of the opening is comparable to the wavelength of light. Examples include the
spreading of light around door edges or the interference pattern produced by a narrow slit.
7.
The camera aperture controls the amount of light entering the camera. A wider aperture (smaller
f-number) allows more light, affecting exposure. However, it also impacts depth of field.
Choosing the right aperture involves a trade-off between exposure and depth of field.
8.
Dispersion is the separation of white light into its component colors. A prism accomplishes this
by refracting different colors by different amounts. The order of colors in the spectrum is red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV).
9.
Optical power measures a lens's ability to converge or diverge light. It is measured in diopters.
Converging lenses have positive power, while diverging lenses have negative power. The
formula for optical power (P) is P = 1/f, where f is the focal length in meters.
10. A convex lens is used to correct hypermetropia by converging incoming light before it reaches
the retina. This compensates for the short focal length of the hypermetropic eye. The corrected
lens allows the eye to focus on near objects more effectively.

there are neat equations governing the position and size of images in curved mirrors. However,
the equations we will explore in this problem are mere approximations, and real objects with
finite size will appear slightly different and distorted than the equations suggest. This may be
considered as a result of spherical aberration, where images appear distorted due to the imperfect
geometric properties spherical surfaces posess regarding reflection. Assume paraaxial rays (rays
travelling at a small angle from the center axis) for all parts of this problem. Angles in diagrams
are greatly exaggerated for clarity.
a.
Consider a spherical mirror with its center on the x-axis. A ray of light travels at an angle
from the x-axis, hits the mirror, and reflects. The radius connecting the center of the
α
circle to the point the light hit forms an angle
with the x-axis. Find the angle
that the
γ
β
reflected ray forms with the x-axis. Express your answer in terms of

b. If a point source produces many of these rays, an image will be formed inside the mirror.
The location of this image is located at the intersection of the x-axis and the ray gotten by
tracing the reflected ray found in part a backwards. The point source is located at a
distance
from the front surface, the image is located at a distance

Instead of a point source, put a ring of radius
centered at the same spot, with its center

axis aligned with the x-axis. If the traditional equations are used for spherical mirrors,
one can find the radius of the resulting image by applying similar triangles. By using this

d. In reality, the image radius and position is slightly different. This is because in the part c
we approximated the ring as a point source, and geometrically extended the argument to
find its size. What actually happens is that each point on the ring is a point source, and
the image for each point can be found via the method in part b. Using this new method,
find the x-position
