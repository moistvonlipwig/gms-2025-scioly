Section 3
Write out a short response to the following questions
1. (4 points) How does the vector form of the law of reflection apply to anisotropic materials
where the surface properties change with direction?
Answer: The law of reflection can be adjusted to consider anisotropic materials by incor-
porating the directional dependence of surface properties, which leads to different reflection
behaviors based on the material’s orientation. In anisotropic materials, surface properties
such as the refractive index can vary depending on the direction of light. [2] The vector
form of the law of reflection still holds, but it requires modification to account for the
variation in reflection depending on the direction. This means that the angle of reflection
is no longer uniform across the surface, as it is influenced by the anisotropic nature of the
material. [2]
2. (4 points) How does the Abbe number affect the dispersion of light in a prism? Calculate the
chromatic aberration for a prism made of crown glass with an Abbe number of 60 when light
enters at an angle of 45°.
Answer: The Abbe number is a measure of how much dispersion (the spreading of light
into its component colors) a material exhibits. A higher Abbe number indicates lower
dispersion, meaning that the material causes less chromatic aberration. [2] For crown glass
with an Abbe number of 60, the dispersion is relatively low. Chromatic aberration can be
calculated by examining the difference in the refractive index of the material for different
wavelengths of light. When light enters the prism at an angle of 45°, the dispersion across
wavelengths leads to slight differences in how each color bends, resulting in chromatic
aberration. [2]
3. (4 points) Explore how additive color theory is applied in modern display technology (e.g.,
OLED) and compare it with subtractive color theory in high-quality printing.
Answer: Additive color theory is used in modern display technologies such as OLED
screens. In this theory, colors are created by combining different intensities of red, green,
and blue (RGB) light. When these colors are mixed together in varying proportions, they
can produce almost any color. For example, combining all three in equal intensity results
in white light. [2] In contrast, subtractive color theory is used in high-quality printing.
This theory involves mixing pigments that absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect
others.
The primary colors in subtractive color theory are cyan, magenta, and yellow
(CMY), and mixing these pigments results in the absorption of more light, thus producing
darker colors. When all three pigments are combined, they ideally absorb all light and
create black. [2]
4. (4 points) Calculate the reflectance for light at normal incidence on a metal surface, given its
complex refractive index. Discuss how this affects the perception of color for different metals
(e.g., gold, silver).
Page 6 of 17

--- Page 7 ---
Answer: The reflectance for light at normal incidence on a metal surface can be calcu-
lated using the Fresnel equations, which take into account the material’s complex refractive
index. This complex refractive index includes both the real part, representing how light
slows down in the material, and the imaginary part, representing how much light is ab-
sorbed by the material. [2] The amount of light reflected at the surface affects how we
perceive the color of metals. For instance, gold appears yellow because it reflects red and
yellow wavelengths more efficiently while absorbing blue and green. Silver, on the other
hand, reflects nearly all wavelengths of visible light, giving it its shiny, white appearance.
[2]
5. (4 points) Explain how spherical aberration affects vision and how the eye naturally compen-
sates for this. Discuss the limitations of this compensation in aging populations.
Answer: Spherical aberration occurs when light rays passing through the periphery of a
lens (such as the eye’s lens) are focused at different points than light rays passing through
the center, causing a blurred image. This effect leads to a decrease in image sharpness. [2]
The eye compensates for spherical aberration naturally by constricting the pupil, which
reduces the amount of light entering through the periphery and allows more focused central
rays to dominate. However, as individuals age, the ability to constrict the pupil diminishes,
and the eye’s lens becomes less flexible, reducing the effectiveness of this compensation
and leading to more pronounced visual distortions. [2]
6. (4 points) Model how the arrangement of photoreceptors in the retina can create blind spots
and why our brains typically don’t notice these spots in normal vision.
Answer: The arrangement of photoreceptors in the retina creates a natural blind spot
at the location where the optic nerve exits the eye because there are no photoreceptors
(rods or cones) in that region. [2] Despite this blind spot, the brain uses information
from the other eye and surrounding visual data to ”fill in” the gap, making the blind
spot essentially unnoticeable in normal vision.
This process is part of how the brain
compensates for missing visual information to create a seamless visual experience. [2]
7. (4 points) Explain how the lensmaker’s equation can be modified to account for spherical
aberration in high-precision optical systems.
Answer: The lensmaker’s equation, which is typically used to calculate the focal length of
a lens based on its curvature and refractive index, can be modified to account for spherical
aberration by including higher-order terms that correct for the varying focal lengths of
peripheral rays versus central rays. [2] In high-precision optical systems, spherical aber-
ration is reduced by altering the lens shape to aspheric profiles, which can help focus all
incoming rays at a single point, regardless of their position on the lens. [1] Additionally,
multi-element lens systems can be designed to counteract aberrations, where different lens
surfaces work together to eliminate distortion. [1]
8. (4 points) Explain the Rayleigh scattering polarization effect in the context of the Earth’s
atmosphere. How does the degree of polarization vary with the angle of observation?
Page 7 of 17

--- Page 8 ---
Answer: Rayleigh scattering occurs when sunlight interacts with the small gas molecules
in Earth’s atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue) more than
longer wavelengths. This scattering effect causes the sky to appear blue. [1] The polar-
ization of light increases as a result of Rayleigh scattering because light waves oscillate
in a specific direction when scattered, which leads to partial polarization of the scattered
light. [1] The degree of polarization depends on the angle of observation: it is maximized
at a 90-degree angle from the sun (perpendicular to the light source) and decreases when
looking directly toward or away from the sun. [2]
9. (4 points) Derive the threshold condition for laser action in terms of population inversion and
discuss the impact of cavity design on laser coherence length.
Answer: For laser action to occur, the population inversion must reach a threshold where
the number of atoms in an excited state exceeds the number in the ground state, en-
abling stimulated emission to dominate over absorption. This threshold condition can be
expressed as a gain coefficient exceeding the losses in the laser cavity. [2] The design of
the cavity affects the coherence length of the laser, with longer cavities generally leading
to longer coherence lengths. This is because the cavity supports fewer modes, allowing
for more coherent light emission. [1] Additionally, mirror reflectivity at the ends of the
cavity influences the coherence length; highly reflective mirrors help maintain coherence
over longer distances. [1]
10. (4 points) Explore how femtosecond lasers can be used in LASIK surgery to correct aberrations
in the human eye. Include a discussion of wavefront-guided techniques.
Answer: Femtosecond lasers are used in LASIK surgery to create precise, controlled
corneal flaps with minimal damage to surrounding tissues.
The extremely short pulse
duration of the femtosecond laser allows for highly accurate cuts, reducing the risk of
complications and improving the healing process. [2] In addition to reshaping the cornea,
femtosecond lasers are employed in wavefront-guided LASIK, which maps the unique im-
perfections (or higher-order aberrations) of a patient’s eye. [1] These aberrations are then
corrected with customized laser ablation, providing improved visual outcomes compared
to traditional LASIK techniques. [1]
11. (4 points) Explain the role of laser diffraction in reading information stored in CD/DVD
media, and discuss how error correction algorithms help in compensating for optical imperfec-
tions.
Answer: Laser diffraction is key in reading information stored in CD/DVD media. A
laser beam is focused onto the disc surface, and the reflected light is diffracted by the pits
and lands encoded on the disc. These differences in reflection are interpreted as binary
data, which the reading system converts into digital information. [2] Due to imperfections
on the disc’s surface, such as scratches or dust, the readout may not be perfect. Error
correction algorithms, such as Reed-Solomon coding, are used to detect and correct small
errors in the data by adding redundancy and error-checking mechanisms to the encoded

information, ensuring accurate data retrieval even in the presence of optical imperfections.

Section 4
Write out your work and answer to the following questions
1. (4 points) A beam of light enters a prism with a refractive index of 1.6 at an angle of 30◦.
Calculate the angle of refraction, to the nearest hundredth of a degree, inside the prism.
Answer:
Using Snell’s law, we have:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
where n1 = 1 (for air), θ1 = 30◦, and n2 = 1.6 (for the prism). Solving for θ2:
1 × sin 30◦= 1.6 × sin θ2
sin θ2 = sin 30◦
1.6
= 0.5
1.6 = 0.3125
θ2 = sin−1(0.3125) ≈18.21◦
Thus, the angle of refraction inside the prism is approximately 18.21◦.
2. (4 points) A plano-convex lens has a radius of curvature of 20 cm. Calculate the focal length,
to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, of the lens if it is made of glass with a refractive index of
1.5.
Answer:
The focal length of a plano-convex lens is given by the lensmaker’s equation:
1
f = (n −1)
 1
R1
−1
R2

For a plano-convex lens, R1 = 20 cm and R2 = ∞(because one surface is flat). The
refractive index n = 1.5. Substituting into the equation:
1
f = (1.5 −1)
 1
20 −1
∞

1
f = 0.5 × 1
20 = 0.5
20 = 0.025
f =
1
0.025 = 40 cm
Thus, the focal length of the lens is 40.0 cm .
3. (4 points) Calculate the total internal reflection angle, to the nearest hundredth of a degree,
for light moving from water (n = 1.33) to air.
Page 10 of 17

--- Page 11 ---
Answer:
The critical angle for total internal reflection can be calculated using the
formula:
sin θc = n2
n1
where n1 = 1.33 (for water) and n2 = 1 (for air). Solving for θc:
sin θc =
1
1.33 = 0.7519
θc = sin−1(0.7519) ≈48.75◦
Thus, the total internal reflection angle is approximately 48.75◦.
4. (4 points) A converging lens has a focal length of 20 cm. An object is placed 30 cm from the
lens. Calculate the position relative to the lens, to the nearest tenth of a centimeter, and the
nature (real or virtual, magnified or diminished) of the image.
Answer:
Using the lens formula:
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
where f = 20 cm (focal length) and do = 30 cm (object distance). Solving for di (image
distance):
1
di
= 1
f −1
do
= 1
20 −1
30 = 3 −2
60
= 1
60
di = 60 cm
Since the image distance is positive, the image is real. To determine the magnification
(M):
M = −di
do
= −60
30 = −2
The negative magnification indicates that the image is inverted. Therefore, the image is
real, inverted, and magnified by a factor of 2. Thus, the image is located 60.0 cm from
the lens, and it is real and magnified.
5. (4 points) A beam of light passes through a double slit, with slit separation of 0.5 mm, and
produces an interference pattern on a screen placed 1.5 meters away. If the wavelength of light
is 600 nm, calculate the distance, to the nearest tenth of a millimeter, between the central
bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe.
Answer:
The distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe
can be calculated using the formula for double-slit interference:
y = mλL
d
Page 11 of 17

--- Page 12 ---
where: - m = 1 (for the first-order fringe), - λ = 600 nm = 600 × 10−9 m (wavelength of
light), - L = 1.5 m (distance to the screen), - d = 0.5 mm = 0.5 × 10−3 m (slit separation).
Substituting the values:
y = 1 × 600 × 10−9 × 1.5
0.5 × 10−3
= 900 × 10−9
0.5 × 10−3 = 1.8 × 10−3 m = 1.8 mm
Thus, the distance between the central bright fringe and the first-order bright fringe is
approximately 1.8 mm .
6. (4 points) Light of wavelength 500 nm passes through a diffraction grating with 104 lines per
centimeter. Calculate the angle, to the nearest hundredth of a degree, where the second-order
maximum occurs.
Answer:
The angle of the second-order maximum can be found using the diffraction
grating formula:
d sin θ = mλ
where: - m = 2 (second-order maximum), - λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10−9 m (wavelength of
light), - d =
1
104 lines/cm =
1
106 lines/m = 10−6 m (grating spacing).
Substituting the values:
10−6 sin θ = 2 × 500 × 10−9
sin θ = 1000 × 10−9
10−6
= 1
Since sin θ = 1, θ = 90◦.
Thus, the second-order maximum occurs at 90.00◦.
7. (4 points) A telescope’s objective lens has a focal length of 2 meters, and its eyepiece has
a focal length of 10 cm. Calculate the magnification produced by this telescope, assuming
normal adjustment.
Answer:
The magnification M of a telescope is given by the formula:
M = fobjective
feyepiece
where fobjective = 2 meters = 200 cm and feyepiece = 10 cm.
Substituting the values:
M = 200
10 = 20
Thus, the magnification produced by the telescope is 20 .
8. (4 points) A monochromatic light source has a wavelength of 400 nm in air. If the light enters
water, which has a refractive index of 1.33, calculate the new wavelength of the light in water,
to the nearest nanometer.
Page 12 of 17

--- Page 13 ---
Answer:
The wavelength of light in a medium is given by:
λmedium = λair
n
where λair = 400 nm and n = 1.33 (refractive index of water).
Substituting the values:
λmedium = 400
1.33 ≈300.75 nm
Rounding to the nearest nanometer, the new wavelength of the light in water is 301 nm .
9. (4 points) A concave lens has a focal length of −20 cm. If an object is placed 15 cm from the
lens, calculate the image distance, to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter, and describe the
nature (real or virtual, magnified or diminished) of the image.
Answer:
Using the lens formula:
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
where f = −20 cm and do = 15 cm. Solving for di (image distance):
1
di
= 1
f −1
do
=
1
−20 −1
15 = −3 −4
60
= −7
60
di = 60
−7 ≈−8.57 cm
The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual. Since the absolute value of di is less
than do, the image is also diminished. Thus, the image is located at −8.57 cm , and it is
virtual and diminished.
10. (4 points) A light ray traveling through glass (refractive index 1.5) strikes a glass-to-air bound-
ary at an angle of incidence of 40◦. Calculate the angle of refraction, to the nearest hundredth
of a degree, of the light as it passes into the air.
Answer:
Using Snell’s law:
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2
where n1 = 1.5 (refractive index of glass), θ1 = 40◦(angle of incidence), and n2 = 1
(refractive index of air). Solving for θ2 (angle of refraction):
1.5 × sin 40◦= 1 × sin θ2
sin θ2 = 1.5 × 0.6428 = 0.9642
θ2 = sin−1(0.9642) ≈74.62◦
Page 13 of 17

--- Page 14 ---
Thus, the angle of refraction is approximately 74.62◦.
11. (4 points) In a double-slit experiment, the distance between the slits is 0.13 mm, and the
distance to the screen is 1 meter. If the second-order bright fringe is observed at a position
12 mm away from the central maximum, calculate the wavelength of the light, to the nearest
nanometer.
Answer:
The position of the m-th order bright fringe in a double-slit experiment is given
by:
y = mλL
d
where:
• y = 12 mm = 12 × 10−3 m (position of the second-order bright fringe)
• m = 2 (second-order)
• L = 1 m (distance to the screen)
• d = 0.13 mm = 0.13 × 10−3 m (slit separation)
Substituting the values:
12 × 10−3 =
2 × λ × 1
0.13 × 10−3
λ = 12 × 10−3 × 0.13 × 10−3
2 × 1
= 780 × 10−9 m = 780 nm
Thus, the wavelength of the light is 780 nm .
12. (4 points) A certain telescope has an angular resolution of 1.22× λ
D, where λ is the wavelength
of light and D is the diameter of the objective lens. If the telescope’s objective lens has a
diameter of 1 meter and the wavelength of light is 500 nm, calculate the angular resolution to
the nearest thousandth of an arcsecond.
Answer:
The formula for angular resolution is:
θ = 1.22 × λ
D
where λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10−9 m and D = 1 m.
Substituting the values:
θ = 1.22 × 500 × 10−9
1
= 6.1 × 10−7 radians
To convert this to arcseconds, recall that 1 radian = 206, 265 arcseconds:
θ = 6.1 × 10−7 × 206, 265 ≈0.126 arcseconds
Page 14 of 17

--- Page 15 ---
Thus, the angular resolution is approximately 0.126 arcseconds .
13. (4 points) A laser emits light with a power of 2 mW and a wavelength of 650 nm. Calculate
the energy, in joules, of a single photon emitted by the laser.
Answer:
The energy of a single photon is given by the formula:
E = hc
λ
where: - h = 6.626 × 10−34 J · s (Planck’s constant), - c = 3.0 × 108 m/s (speed of light), -
λ = 650 nm = 650 × 10−9 m (wavelength of the laser light).
Substituting the values:
E = 6.626 × 10−34 × 3.0 × 108
650 × 10−9
= 1.9878 × 10−25
650 × 10−9
≈3.058 × 10−19 J
Thus, the energy of a single photon is approximately 3.06 × 10−19 J .
14. (4 points) A concave mirror has a focal length of 12 cm. Calculate the magnification of the
image if the object is placed 8 cm from the mirror.
Answer:
First, we use the mirror equation to find the image distance:
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
where:
• f = 12 cm (focal length of the concave mirror)
• do = 8 cm (object distance)
Solving for di (image distance):
1
12 = 1
8 + 1
di
1
di
= 1
12 −1
8 = 2 −3
24
= −1
24
di = −24 cm
Now, the magnification M is given by:
M = −di
do
= −−24
8
= 3
Page 15 of 17

--- Page 16 ---
Thus, the magnification of the image is 3 , meaning the image is magnified and virtual
(since the image distance is negative).
15. (8 points) Prove that when light is incident at Brewster’s angle, the reflected light is completely
polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Hint: Start by using Fresnel’s equations and
prove that the reflection coefficient for light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence goes to
zero at Brewster’s angle.
Answer:
Brewster’s angle, denoted as θB, is the angle of incidence at which light, when
reflected from the boundary between two media, becomes fully polarized perpendicular to
the plane of incidence. The condition for Brewster’s angle is given by:
θB = tan−1
n2
n1

where:
• n1 is the refractive index of the first medium,
• n2 is the refractive index of the second medium.
At Brewster’s angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular, meaning:
θr + θt = 90◦
where θr is the reflection angle and θt is the refraction angle.
To describe the reflection and transmission of light at the boundary, we use Fresnel’s
equations for the reflection coefficients of parallel and perpendicular polarizations.
• For parallel-polarized light (r∥):
r∥= n2 cos θi −n1 cos θt
n2 cos θi + n1 cos θt
• For perpendicular-polarized light (r⊥):
r⊥= n1 cos θi −n2 cos θt
n1 cos θi + n2 cos θt
where:
• θi is the angle of incidence
• θt is the angle of refraction, related by Snell’s law: n1 sin θi = n2 sin θt
At Brewster’s angle, the reflected light is completely polarized perpendicular to the plane
of incidence. This implies that the reflection coefficient for the parallel component r∥must
be zero. Let’s prove that this is true.
Page 16 of 17

--- Page 17 ---
We know that at Brewster’s angle:
θr + θt = 90◦
⇒
θt = 90◦−θB
Using Snell’s law:
n1 sin θB = n2 sin θt = n2 cos θB
Substituting this into Fresnel’s equation for r∥:
r∥= n2 cos θB −n1 cos(90◦−θB)
n2 cos θB + n1 cos(90◦−θB)
Since cos(90◦−θB) = sin θB, we get:
r∥= n2 cos θB −n1 sin θB
n2 cos θB + n1 sin θB
At Brewster’s angle, tan θB = n2
n1, or equivalently, n1 tan θB = n2, which implies:
n1 sin θB = n2 cos θB
Substituting this into the equation for r∥:
r∥= n2 cos θB −n2 cos θB
n2 cos θB + n2 cos θB
= 0
Thus, at Brewster’s angle, the reflection coefficient for parallel-polarized light is zero,
meaning no parallel-polarized light is reflected.
Since r∥= 0 at Brewster’s angle, no light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence is
reflected. Therefore, the reflected light is fully polarized perpendicular to the plane of
incidence (s-polarized). ■
