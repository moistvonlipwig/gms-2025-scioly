ANSWER KEY
49. Neuron cells do not express TMPRSS2 but express ACE2. However, neurons are capable of being
infected by SARS-CoV-2. Explain how this is possible. [3 points]
It must be using the Endosomal Pathway (or Neuropilin) [+2], which does not require
TMPRSS2 [+1]
50. You want to investigate a SARS-CoV-2 variant with mutations on its spike protein that has a heightened
ability to infect cells. Suggest two hypotheses as to how mutations to the spike protein may increase virulence
of SARS-CoV-2. [3 points]
For any of the following [+1.5] for a maximum of 3 points:
●
Increased binding to ACE2
●
Increased binding or cleavage by TMPRSS2
●
Better fusion by S2
●
Increased binding or cleavage by furin
●
Better immune evasion (avoid B cell antibodies or T cell presentation)
No points for cathepsin or other proteins that are not directly related to mediating fusion.
51. A patient has a dysfunctional ACE2 protein that is unable to be expressed on the surface of cells. Will
SARS-CoV-2 be able to infect them? Explain. [2 points]
No [+1], both pathways require ACE2, so neither pathway will be useable [+1]
52. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles spread from the throat to the saliva before any symptoms appear. Explain why
this lack of symptoms might be beneficial for its transmissibility. [2 points]
Virus can be spread through coughs/sneezes/saliva/aerosols [+1] before the host knows they
are infected/can take precautions [+1]
53. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped plus single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus. Does SAR-S-CoV-2 +ssRNA
require any transcription before translation by ribosomes? Why or why not? [2 points]
No, it does not need any transcription [+1]
ssRNA directly codes for SARS-CoV-2 proteins since it is plus stranded [+1]
54. Does SARS-CoV-2 integrate into the host genome? Does it have a lytic or lysogenic life cycle? [1 point]
No [+0.5] lytic [+0.5]
