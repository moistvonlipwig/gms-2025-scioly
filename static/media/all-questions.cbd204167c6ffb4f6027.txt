STATION A: MICROSCOPY  
 
 
   1. A microscope has an 10 objective and oculars of 4X, 10X, 40X and 
       100X.   What is the range of magnification for this microscope.   (lowest to highest) 
 
 
  2. A student prepares a slide with the letters "GR" and positions it on the stage in the  
normal reading position.  When viewed, how will the "GR " will appear?   
Draw it on your answer sheet. 
 
  
  3. Examine the diagram of the stage with the millimeter ruler from a 10X objective.  
      What is the diameter of this field of view in millimeters?  in micrometers or mcm?   
 
 
  4. What would be the diameter of the 40X field of view based upon diameter of the 10X  
      objective from question # 5 in millimeters?        in micrometers or mcm?  
      (Remember: it must be calculated using the information from 
       question # 4 and the ratio of magnification because it is less than one mm) 
 
 
 
  5. Examine the Photo of Spirogyra.  Assume that the length of the photo is the same 
      as the diameter of the 40X field of view calculated in question 5, what is the length

The image below illustrates two major SARS-CoV-2 pathways used to enter host eukaryotic cells: the endosomal
and cell surface pathway. In the endosomal pathway, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis after its spike protein
binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In the cell surface pathway, spike protein binds ACE2 similarly,
but the S2 subunit of the spike protein is cleaved by the host cell’s transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2). Cleavage of S2 allows S2 to facilitate the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane.
Use this model to answer the following questions.
49. Neuron cells do not express TMPRSS2 but express ACE2. However, neurons are capable of being
infected by SARS-CoV-2. Explain how this is possible. [3 points]
50. You want to investigate a SARS-CoV-2 variant with mutations on its spike protein that has a

(5 pts) 66. This picture is showing an Algal Bloom.  An algal bloom is a result of an 
abundance of nutrients, especially phosphorus.  Because of the excess nutrients the algae 
increase their population dramatically. Each alga is short-lived, and the result is a high 
concentration of dead organic matter which starts to decay. The decay process consumes 
dissolved oxygen in the water, resulting in hypoxic conditions. Without sufficient dissolved 
oxygen in the water, animals and plants may die off in large numbers. 
 
 
 
 
 
(3 pts) 67.  This is an example of the Streak Technique. In microbiology, Streaking is a 
technique used to isolate a pure strain from a single species of microorganism, often 
bacteria. Samples can then be taken from the resulting colonies and a microbiological culture 
can be grown on a new plate so that the organism can be identified, studied, or tested.

Lean Mean Green Machine (43)
Dr. Ene Ockamat, a leading marine ecologist, has encountered the organism pictured on the
next page, Anabaena, in his research. Anabaena is a cyanobacteria, a photosynthesizing
prokaryote.
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

--- Page 5 ---

1) What pigment is primarily responsible for
the green color in Anabaena? Be speciûc for
full credit. (2)
2) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the
following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'.
(6)
1.
Anabaena is an obligate anaerobe.
2.
Anabaena is a facultative anaerobe.
3.
Anabaena is an obligate aerobe.
4.
Anabaena is a photoautotroph.
5.
Anabaena is a photoheterotroph.
6.
Anabaena is a chemoheterotroph.
Dr. Ockamat tells you that the two bigger cells in the image above are called heterocysts.
Heterocysts are cells specialized for nitrogen ûxation.
3) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
Oxidative photosynthesis provides usable energy sources to organisms.
2.
Nitrogen ûxation consumes organisms’ energy reserves.
3.
Nitrites and Nitrates are the end-products of nitrogen ûxation.
4.
Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter are types of bacteria that perform the same step in the
nitrogen cycle as Heterocysts.
5.
The heterocysts have thicker cell walls than the other bacteria pictured.
6.
Heterocysts have a lower concentration of the pigment from question 1 in this section
than the other cells in the picture.
A key diﬃculty of performing nitrogen ûxation is that the enzyme that performs nitrogen ûxation
functions best in cells with very low concentrations of oxygen.
4) What metabolic process in Anabaena and many other organisms (including humans) results
in the decrease of oxygen concentrations in a cell over time and produces usable energy for
the cell? (1)
5) What is the name for the enzyme/class of enzymes which catalyze the reduction of diatomic
nitrogen (N2)? (3)
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

--- Page 6 ---
5
For species like Anabaena that perform photosynthesis, it can be a challenge to create an
oxygen-free environment.
6) How many photosystems are involved in the process of photosynthesis? (1)
7) Which photosystem catalyzes the splitting of water and production of oxygen? (1)
8) What is the name for the process in which one extracts energy from light WITHOUT using
the photosystem in the above question? Does this process result in the production of oxygen?
(3)
Anabaena employs an interesting strategy to solve this problem. Some individuals develop into
heterocysts, which focus primarily on nitrogen ûxation, while the rest of the cells focus on
photosynthesis. Then, the two diﬀerent types of cells in the population <trade= resources, so
every cell can satisfy its metabolic needs.
9) What general class of macromolecules are imported into Heterocysts from the other cells in
the greatest quantities? (2)
A) Carbohydrates
B) Lipids
C) Proteins
D) Nucleic Acids
10) Nitrogen ûxed in heterocysts is transported to the other cells in the form of what
monomers? Hint: it is easier to transfer more stable monomers than less stable ones. (2)
A) Simple Sugars
B) Fatty Acids
C) Amino Acids
D) Nucleotides
11) The relation between the heterocysts and the other Anabaena cells is an example of what
ecological interaction? (2)
A) Mutualism
B) Commensalism
C) Parasitism
D) Protocooperation
Dr. Ockamat is intrigued by Anabaena’s unique symbiotic relationships. In order to ûnd similar
organisms to study, he sequences the 16S ribosomal RNA of Anabaena and compares it to that
of organisms on the microbe list. When he does so, he is extremely surprised to ûnd a close
match to a Eukaryotic species!!
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

12) Why would Dr. Ockamat initially be surprised at ûnding a close match between the 16S
ribosomal RNA sequence in a prokaryotic species and the rRNA of a eukaryotic species? (4)
The particular Eukaryotic species he ûnds a match to is
shown to the left.
13) What is the genus of this species? (4)
14) What particular organelle in this species is most likely
responsible for its green color? (2)
15) Explain why Dr. Ockamat found such a close match between the ribosomal RNA of
Anabaena and this species. (4)

Esports, which is known to
induce *neurological decay*.
In the image above, the extracted sample (containing P. Esports) is the 200 mL in the leftmost
üask. The concentration of a solution is the number of bacteria/CFUs present per milliliter.
All the test tubes are initially ûlled with 9 mL of pure, distilled water (no bacteria).

His experimental procedure is as follows:
1.
First, transfer 1 mL of solution from the 200 mL solution to the test tube marked <1=.
2.
Repeatedly extract a small volume of solution from test tube <1= and dispense it back
into this vial.
3.
Transfer 1 mL of the solution in test tube 1 to the petri dish (red, agar plate), and spread
it evenly across the surface.
4.
Transfer 1 mL of the solution in test tube 1 to test tube 2.
5.
Repeat steps 2-4 for the rest of the test tubes.
1) Between which steps (1&2, 2&3, 3&4, 4&2) would it be important to change one’s pipette
tip? HINT: You don’t want to contaminate a solution that has a low concentration of bacteria
with a pipette tip that has a high concentration of bacteria. (4)
2) Which steps (1-4) change the concentration of the solution in vial 1? (4)
3) What is the name of the procedure Sill is executing? (4)
4) What is the purpose of step 2? (4)
Sill needs to make sure he has the correct lab equipment at hand, and knows how and when to
use them. Match the following instruments to their name, function and best intended purpose in
this lab. Use ONLY CAPITAL LETTERS on your answer sheet.

9) Calculate the ratio between the concentration of bacteria in vial 4 and the initial beaker. (3)
10) Calculate the ratio between the expected number of bacterial colonies on plate 4 and the
expected number of colonies on the leftmost plate. (5)
After performing his procedure and incubating the bacteria for some time, Sill counts 37
colonies on plate 3.
11) Calculate the concentration of bacteria in CFUs/mL in the original sample. (5)
12) What does CFU stand for? (1)
13) How many colonies would you expect Sill to see on the other plates? Why would Sill
choose to report the count of this particular plate as opposed to other ones? (6)
After arriving at a count of the bacteria in his sample, Sill is now highly concerned. He thinks P.
Esports is about as detrimental to human health as some strains of E. Coli.
14) According to the WHO, what is the recommended limit on the concentration of E. Coli in
drinking water? (2)
A) 0 CFUs/100 mL
B) 1 CFU/100 mL
C) 10 CFUs/100 mL
D) 100 CFUs/100 mL

Now aware of the serious problem at hand, Sill needs to ûnd out more about how fast P.
Esports grows! This requires being able to quickly count the number of bacteria in particular
samples.
15) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
When Sill plates a small solution on agar, he will need to incubate his plate before he
can start to see colonies of bacteria forming.
2.
For the purposes of counting, 1 colony on the plate would be treated as 1 CFU.
3.
An optical density measurement is proportional to the concentration of microbes in
solution.
4.
The reading on an optical density measurement is proportional to ten to the power of
the number of microbes in the solution.
5.
It would be appropriate to measure the optical density of a solution of E. Coli using light
with a wavelength of 600 nm.
6.
Removing 10 mL of solution from the 200mL üask, assuming that it is evenly mixed, will
NOT change the measured optical density.
[Note: some answers from section 3 may be useful in completing section 4]
Section 4
A Cultured Individual (52)
Now that he understands how to count bacteria, Sill needs to ûgure out how to grow them. He
needs to decide between culturing his P. Esports on an agar plate and culturing it in a liquid
medium.
Below is the composition of a MacKonkey agar plate (MAC):
●
Peptone – 17 g
●
Proteose peptone – 3 g
●
Lactose – 10 g
●
Bile salts – 1.5 g
●
Sodium chloride – 5 g
●
Neutral red – 0.03 g
●
Crystal violet – 0.001 g
●
Agar – 13.5 g
●
Water – 1 liter; adjust pH to ~7.0
●
Sodium taurocholate - 0.05%
HINT: Neutral red is a dye that turns pink in acidic solutions and yellow in basic solutions.
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

--- Page 11 ---
10
1) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
MAC is a deûned medium.
2.
Crystal violet binds to and inhibits the growth of gram positive bacteria.
3.
This is a selective medium.
4.
Lactose is the only nutrient source in the plate.
5.
Bacteria which ferment lactose will turn the plate pink.
6.
This is a diﬀerential medium.
Below is the composition of LB broth, the liquid medium Sill is considering:
●
Tryptone - 10 g
●
Yeast Extract - 5 g
●
Sodium chloride - 10 g
●
Water - 1 liter; adjust pH to ~7.0
with NaOH
(Autoclave the mixture for 25 min at 120°C before use).
2) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
This is a deûned medium.
2.
The pH of this medium is expected to üuctuate signiûcantly once bacteria are
introduced because NaOH is not a buﬀer.
3.
This is a selective medium.
4.
LB broth performs exceptionally in culturing E. Coli bacteria.
5.
The purpose of autoclaving the mixture is to get rid of any bacteria that may have been
introduced into it during the preparation process.
6.
This is a diﬀerential medium.
Now, Sill can assess the growth of P. Esports. He takes a small sample from the 200mL beaker
from before and adds it to a solution of LB broth in a test tube. For this part of the lab
experiment, Sill will use an optical density measurement to assess the number of bacteria in the
tube over time.
Note that Sill does something unusual for this experiment - he keeps adding new nutrients
to the broth and ûlters out toxic waste products from it.
3) What phase of the bacterial growth curve do you expect to be absent under these
conditions? (2)
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

0.8
Sill tests the original 200 mL solution and ûnds that it has an optical density of 0.4. Use either
your calculated value from problem #11 of Section 2 or the conversion below to plot the
bacterial growth curve below (remember to check what the axes are).
Conversion: If you are unsure about your answer to Section 3, #11, you may use the
conversion that 2,000 bacteria (CFUs) per milliliter corresponds to an OD of 0.4 for up to
75% partial credit.
(For those of you who may not have brought an appropriate calculator, it may be helpful to
know that log(2) = 0.3, log(5) = 0.7, log(7) = 0.85, log(8) = 0.9, log(9) = 0.95)
4) Plot the data from the table above, then draw a curve of best ût (note the axes!). (12)
5) Estimate the doubling time of P. Esports at its maximum growth rate. Compare this value to
typical bacterial doubling times. (3)
Sill notices that something is oﬀwith the above graph. At some point in time T, his lab assistant
Baryan No-aura must have accidentally added a high concentration of an antibiotic!
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

--- Page 13 ---
12
6) Given that the antibiotic was added exactly after an even number of minutes had passed,
what is T, the time when the antibiotic was added? (2)
7) Was the antibiotic bacteriostatic or bactericidal? (1)
Sill then added a small sample of a new microbe, A. pillaius, to this colony. This microbe has a
plasmid containing resistance genes to the antibiotic Sill added, but is less eﬃcient in exploiting
the nutrient source in the broth than P. Esports.
The growth curves for P. Esports and A. pillaius in the broth are shown below.
8) Label the parts of the growth curve for the A. Pillaius. (4)
9) Give 2 examples of community interactions that are demonstrated between P. Esports and A.
Pillaius. Explain (4).
10) Give reasoning for why the growth curves of P. Esports and A. Pillaius look like they do. Be
sure to explain what triggers the changes in concentrations of the microbes in each stage. Note
that Sill adds the antibiotic from question #6 at some point in time. Indicate what events trigger
the changes between stages. (12)

Super?? Resolution Microscopy (53)
Legendary Professor Chavid Den has long been known as one of the world’s greatest experts in
cryptography, aviation engineering, and forensic science. However, Chavid is also one of the
world’s leading experts in microscopy. Help the professor analyze one of their new prototype
microscopes!
Chavid’s work centers around light microscopy, which has some unique advantages over
electron microscopy.
1) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
Light microscopy has a higher resolution than electron microscopy.
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

--- Page 15 ---
14
2.
Sample preparation for light microscopy is usually faster than sample preparation for
electron microscopy.
3.
Light microscopy can be used to visualize live specimens, while electron microscopy
cannot.
4.
Electron microscopy is much more capable of generating 3D images of specimens than
light microscopy.
5.
The vast majority of dyes and dyeing procedures in electron microscopy are lethal to
specimens, while the vast majority of dyes and dyeing procedures used in light
microscopy are not lethal.
6.
The majority of dyes used in electron microscopy can also be used eﬀectively in light
microscopy.
2) Identify the parts of the microscope in Professor Den’s sketch of the microscope above.
Ignore the red and blue parts of the sketch. Provide a more speciûc name than <photon
source= for the component labeled <J=. (7)
Note that in traditional light microscopy, the specimen is located between the photon source
(part J) and the photon detector (one’s eye), as is pictured in Prof. Den’s sketch.
3) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
In TEM, the electron detector is located in between the electron source and the
specimen.
2.
In SEM, the specimen is located in between the electron
source and the electron detector.
3.
The wavelength of a photon in Light Microscopy is typically
shorter than the De Broglie wavelength of an electron used
in electron microscopy.
4.
The images at right depict T4 Phages.
5.
The top image at right is from a SEM, while the lower image
is from a TEM.
6.
The lower image is about 5000 times more magniûed than
the upper image.
4) Calculate the volume, in mL, of ONE individual pictured in the
pictures to the right. Answers within a factor of 100 of the true
answer will get full credit, and partial credit will be awarded only if
work is shown. (4)

Professor Den is impressed by the magniûcation of the images above. However, they think that
they can do even better with his light microscope. Chavid notices that the objective lenses on
his microscope are labeled 4x, 10x, 40x, and 100x.
5) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
Higher magniûcation objectives are usually shorter than lower magniûcation objective
lenses.
2.
The objective which states <4x= actually magniûes the image by a factor of 40.
3.
Most modern microscopes have a coaxial ûne adjustment and coarse adjustment knob
(coaxial means that the knobs rotate around the same axis)
4.
If one uses microscope oil immersion, it is important to apply the oil to the 100x
objective lens before turning it directly at the stage as otherwise it could contaminate
the specimen.
5.
Kohler illumination is a more recent technique then Critical/Nelsonian illumination, and
results in very even lighting of samples, which can increase contrast.
6.
Decreasing the numerical aperture of an objective lens increases the theoretical limit of
its resolution.
Professor Den has come up with a brilliant new idea to increase resolution! They will attempt to
directly increase the magniûcation of their light microscope by attaching a new, adjustable
objective to the previous 40x objective (red/blue parts on diagram)!
6) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)
1.
If Professor Den’s adjustable objective magniûes the image by a factor of 20, the
combined 40x/adjustable objective lens will have the same magniûcation as a 60x
objective.
2.
There is precisely one location of the adjustable lens for which the stage is a focal plane
(i.e., the image will only be perfectly <in focus= for one location of the lens)
3.
If Chavid took multiple pictures of the specimen through the microscope, each with
slightly varied positions of the adjustable lens, deconvolution software could be used to
create a much clearer image of the specimen.
4.
If Chavid looked at a specimen moving up and to the right under an unmodiûed light
microscope, it would appear to be moving down and to the left.
5.
If Chavid looked at a specimen moving up and to the right through his modiûed light
microscope, it would appear to be moving down and to the left.
Please DO NOT write on this exam!

Intro biochemistry Teacher’s Assistant (TA) Roon has got fed up with ID events and wants to
destroy all the microbes on earth before Bacteriology becomes a thing. However, she likes
birds, insects, and trees, so she wants to minimize the eﬀect of her antibiotics on eukaryotic
cells. She ûrst targets mechanisms of bacterial locomotion.
1) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)

3.
The basal bodies of prokaryotic üagella have eight distinct ring-based layers.

Lophotrichous bacteria have all their üagella concentrated at a single spot on the
bacterial surface
5.
Peritrichous bacteria have üagella pointing in all directions.
6.
E. Coli is a Lophotrichous bacteria.
She thinks that üagella are a better target for a medicine than cilia because some human cells
also have motile cilia, making them potentially vulnerable to the drug!
2) Give an example of a human cell that has motile cilia. Hint: there are some examples among
cells in the brain and lungs. (2)
From her extensive studies of biology, TA Roon remembers that
there already exist natural immune mechanisms to target
proteins in bacterial üagella! The green protein in the diagram to
the right is Zebraûsh Toll-Like Receptor 5.
3) What is the name of the orange protein in the above diagram,
which is a key part of bacterial üagella? (2)
4) What type of representation is used to depict the proteins in
the diagram to the right? (1)

5) The orange protein has a large number of what common secondary structural motif? (1)
Satisûed with the human body’s innate ability to target key parts of bacterial locomotion, TA
Roon turns her attention to other key diﬀerences between bacterial and eukaryotic cells and
potential targets for his antibiotics. She starts oﬀby considering penicillins and their mechanism
of action.
In the above diagrams, the penicillin molecule is the one with two rings. When it binds to a
particular amino acid on a particular protein (the other molecule in its images), its beta-lactam
ring is destroyed.
6) What is the hybridization of the blue nitrogen atom in penicillin BEFORE binding to the amino
acid (HINT: consider resonance structures)? (2)
7) The beta lactam ring is a cyclic form of what biologically important functional group? (1)
8) What enzyme/class of enzymes, critical for cell wall construction in gram-positive bacteria, is
inactivated when it binds to penicillin? (4)
9) What is the name of the particular amino acid which binds to the penicillin molecule? (1)
10) Is the bond between the protein and the penicillin molecule covalent, ionic, or neither? (1)
11) Who discovered penicillin? What year did they get the nobel prize in? (2)

12) Modern biology labs use bioengineered yeast instead of bioengineered bacteria to produce
penicillin, but bacteria are used to produce a wide variety of other compounds. Why do we use
yeast instead of bacteria to produce penicillin? (4)
13) Is penicillin more eﬀective against gram positive or gram negative bacteria? (1)
TA Roon wants to test whether penicillin would be eﬀective against a particular bacteria which
is a common human pathogen. She performs a gram stain on this bacteria!

When applying penicillin V to a particular strain of this bacteria, TA Roon is disappointed to see
that it has no eﬀect. TA Roon then treats this strain of bacteria with Amoxicillin and Cephalexin,
other Beta-lactams, and still sees no result!
17) What is the name for this particular strain of bacteria, a dangerous antibiotic-resistant
human pathogen (feel free to abbreviate)? (4)
Now, TA Roon turns her attention to tetracyclines.
Tetracycline is an antibiotic that interferes with ribosomes! Consider the diagram of the
tetracycline-ribosome interaction above.
18) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)

4.
Tetracycline requires cobalt cofactors for proper action
5.
Post-transcriptional modiûcations like m^2G are unique to Eukaryotes and Archaea

which makes them resistant to tetracycline. Write out the scientiûc name of the organism
pictured on the previous page. (4)
Speciûcally, bacteria with an AGA -> TTC mutation in nucleotides 926-928 have demonstrated
resistance to Tetracycline.
In the early 2000s, researchers invented a Real-Time PCR screen for 16S rRNA mutations
associated with the organism pictured on the previous page.
They designed the following hybridization probes to test for the presence of mutant strains. The
probes only diﬀer in the underlined section:
Probe 1: 5′-AAG GTT CTT CGT GTA TCT TCG-3′

PCR can be used on bacteria that are no longer alive, which is a major beneût over
many other screening techniques.
3.
PCR requires the design and use of RNA primers to be eﬀective.
4.
DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus Furiosus is more accurate when used in PCR than
DNA polymerase from Thermus Aquaticus.

To perform the screen, the researchers attached a üuorescent indicator to ONE of the probes,
and let it bind to target sequences. Probes release üuorescent signals immediately after they
separate from the target sequence. The below ûgure shows the üuorescence of the samples
with the indicated ratios of mutant to wild-type DNA being tested.
22) Multiple Select: Identify whether each of the following statements are true 'T' or false 'F'. (6)

bacteria in a particular sample have the mutant allele.
5.
This test can detect the presence of mutants with high sensitivity if at least 20% of the
bacteria in a particular sample have the mutant allele.

After all those PCR questions, TA Roon wants a break from DNA replication. She knows that
very high concentrations of Nalidixic Acid will aﬀect bacterial replication, but doesn’t know
exactly how it works. She knows that it inhibits some mystery protein crucial to bacterial
genome replication. To ûgure out exactly which protein Nalidixic Acid inhibits, TA Roon uses
cool techniques to identify the DNA sequences that the mystery protein binds to. She ûrst
thinks that the mystery protein may be DnaA.
23) Which of the following best describes the function of DnaA? (2)
A. Initiate genome replication
B. Relieve negative genomic supercoils
C. Transcribe DNA into RNA
D. Terminate genome replication
Fill in the blanks on your answer sheet:
24) DnaA binds to a speciûc sequence called the _____ ____ _____ (abbreviated DUE), (2)
25) which is located within the _____ ____ _____ (abbreviated oriC) (2)
TA Roon’s cool techniques reveal that the mystery protein binds to sequences with very high
GC content (lots of G-C base pairs).
26) Would you expect this region to be easier or harder to separate into two strands than the
rest of the genome, on average? Does this support the conclusion that DnaA is the mystery
protein? (4)
A. Easier, Yes
B. Harder, Yes
C. Easier, No
D. Harder, No
TA Roon ûgures out that the mystery protein has both ligase and nuclease activity, and that
Nalidixic Acid selectively inhibits the ligase activity of this protein.
27) How would you expect the number of double-strand breaks in the genome to change as a
result of Nalidixic Acid exposure? (2)
28) Is Nalidixic Acid bacteriostatic or bactericidal? (2)
TA Roon reminds you that this antibiotic selectively targets bacterial genome replication.
29) What is the mystery protein? (12)
30) Nalidixic Acid is an example of what bicyclic class of antibiotics? (4)

Now that you have determined the shape of this mysterious bacteria, you still need more information in order to uncover its
identity. You realize that the next best step to take is to perform a Gram Stain.
5. In order to begin performing your gram stain, you must first fix your mysterious bacteria to the slide in order to make sure that
it does not get rinsed off during the procedure. This can be done by 2 main mechanisms: Chemical Fixation and Heat Fixation.
Describe 1 advantage that Chemical Fixation has on Heat Fixation. [1]
-
Overheating bacterial cells may cause their shapes to be distorted leading to observation mistakes
-
Chemical Fixation is better at preserving the cell morphology
-
Heating can result in the destruction of intracellular integrity
-
Delicate samples with fragile structures are at risk of during heat fixation
-
etc.

Section C: Culture/Growth [33 pts]
1.
You discover a cell line capable of undergoing all major metabolic pathways in animal cells. Four mutants of this cell line
are known, with each mutant producing only one defective protein. You isolate each mutant (1-4) and grow them on a
medium without glucose. Then, you add protein, carbohydrate, and fat solution to the media individually and measure
the relative levels of ATP production by the cell. Protein solution consisted of various amino acids, carbohydrate solution
consisted of various sugars, and fat solution consisted of triglycerides. In further experiments, you discover that when an
inhibitor for beta oxidation is added to the animal cell, Mutant 2 no longer metabolizes fats. A “+” indicates high ATP
production levels while a “-” indicates low ATP production levels. [5] Which of the following is TRUE about your
experiments?
a.
On average, if proteins, carbohydrates, and fats were added to the media of each mutant, ATP production is
highest in Mutant 1.
b.
Fermentation occurs when protein is added to the media of Mutant 2 and Mutant 4.

You review some preliminary work that Neil has done (poorly). He has done a fluctuation Ames test with the strong mutagen
benzo[a]pyrene as a positive control (Row A) and epsom salt as the negative control (Row H) and no additives in Row G. Then
in rows B-F he tested increasing concentration of a Mystery Compound. In columns 1-4 a tester strain for single nucleotide
polymorphisms was tested. In Columns 5-8 a tester for frameshifts was tested. In Columns 9-12 a special strain (Strain X) was
added that produces large amounts of bicarbonate (a buffer) as a respiratory product instead of CO2 when unmutated but is
not auxotrophic. The pH indicator in each well changes from purple to yellow when acid is introduced into the environment.
All wells have media that does not contain histidine and was inoculated with the strains as indicated above. Assume all
mutagenesis is 100% effective for controls. The figure below shows his results.

Section C: Culture/Growth [35 pts]
1.
You discover a cell line capable of undergoing all major metabolic pathways in animal cells. Four mutants of this cell line
are known, with each mutant producing only one defective protein. You isolate each mutant (1-4) and grow them on a
medium without glucose. Then, you add protein, carbohydrate, and fat solution to the media individually and measure
the relative levels of ATP production by the cell. Protein solution consisted of various amino acids, carbohydrate solution
consisted of various sugars, and fat solution consisted of triglycerides. In further experiments, you discover that when an
inhibitor for beta oxidation is added to the animal cell, Mutant 2 no longer metabolizes fats. A “+” indicates high ATP
production levels while a “-” indicates low ATP production levels. [5] Which of the following is TRUE about your
experiments?

You review some preliminary work that Neil has done (poorly). He has done a fluctuation Ames test with the strong mutagen
benzo[a]pyrene as a positive control (Row A) and epsom salt as the negative control (Row H) and no additives in Row G. Then
in rows B-F he tested increasing concentration of a Mystery Compound. In columns 1-4 a tester strain for single nucleotide
polymorphisms was tested. In Columns 5-8 a tester for frameshifts was tested. In Columns 9-12 a special strain (Strain X) was
added that produces large amounts of bicarbonate (a buffer) as a respiratory product instead of CO2 when unmutated but is
not auxotrophic. The pH indicator in each well changes from purple to yellow when acid is introduced into the environment.
All wells have media that does not contain histidine and was inoculated with the strains as indicated above. Assume all
mutagenesis is 100% effective for controls. The figure below shows his results.
