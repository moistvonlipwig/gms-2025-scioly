The image below illustrates two major SARS-CoV-2 pathways used to enter host eukaryotic cells: the endosomal
and cell surface pathway. In the endosomal pathway, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis after its spike protein
binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In the cell surface pathway, spike protein binds ACE2 similarly,
but the S2 subunit of the spike protein is cleaved by the host cell’s transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2). Cleavage of S2 allows S2 to facilitate the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane.
Use this model to answer the following questions.
49. Neuron cells do not express TMPRSS2 but express ACE2. However, neurons are capable of being
infected by SARS-CoV-2. Explain how this is possible. [3 points]
50. You want to investigate a SARS-CoV-2 variant with mutations on its spike protein that has a
heightened ability to infect cells. Suggest two hypotheses as to how mutations to the spike protein may
increase virulence of SARS-CoV-2. [3 points]
51. A patient has a dysfunctional ACE2 protein that is unable to be expressed on the surface of cells. Will
SARS-CoV-2 be able to infect them? Explain. [2 points]
52. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles spread from the throat to the saliva before any symptoms appear. Explain
why this lack of symptoms might be beneficial for its transmissibility. [2 points]
53. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped plus single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus. Does SAR-S-CoV-2 +ssRNA
require any transcription before translation by ribosomes? Why or why not? [2 points]
54. Does SARS-CoV-2 integrate into the host genome? Does it have a lytic or lysogenic life cycle? [1 point]
