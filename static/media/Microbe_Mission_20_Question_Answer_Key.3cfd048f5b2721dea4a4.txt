Microbe Mission Test Answer Key
Question 1: Cocci (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), Bacilli (e.g., Escherichia coli), Spirochetes (e.g., Treponema pallidum).
Question 2: Fixation, crystal violet stain, iodine treatment, decolorization, safranin counterstain. Gram-positive bacteria
retain purple color, Gram-negative appear pink.
Question 3: Lag phase, log phase (exponential growth), stationary phase, death phase.
Question 4: Lytic: Virus replicates immediately, lysing the host cell. Lysogenic: Virus integrates into the host genome,
remaining dormant before activation.
Question 5: a) Bread/beer fermentation, b) Algal biofuels, c) Bioremediation.
Question 6: Generates a proton gradient across the membrane, driving ATP synthesis via ATP synthase.
Question 7: Liquid culture (growth in broth) vs. agar plates (solid medium for colony formation).
Question 8: Attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation, release.
Question 9: Observation that microscopic counts of bacteria exceed colony counts on plates due to non-culturable
organisms.
Question 10: Misfolded proteins that induce abnormal folding in normal proteins, leading to neurodegenerative diseases.
Question 11: Contribute to cell wall structure and function, aid in ion transport, and provide rigidity.
Question 12: Organisms thriving in extreme conditions: Halophiles (high salt), thermophiles (high heat), psychrophiles
(cold).
Question 13: Bacteria: No nucleus, circular DNA, no organelles. Eukaryotes: Nucleus, linear DNA, organelles.
Question 14: Catalase breaks down H2O2 into water and oxygen, preventing oxidative damage to cells.
Question 15: Selective media inhibit certain microbes while allowing others to grow; differential media distinguish
microbes based on biochemical reactions.
Question 16: Malaria and cerebral malaria, transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.
Question 17: Sterilization eliminates all microbes; disinfection reduces microbial load but may not eliminate all.
Question 18: Brightfield microscopy (general observation) and SEM (detailed surface structures).
Question 19: Use of microbes to degrade pollutants, e.g., Pseudomonas degrading oil spills.
Question 20: Endospores protect genetic material, enabling bacteria to withstand extreme conditions like heat and

desiccation.
