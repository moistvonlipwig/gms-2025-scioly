Extended Problems (show work for partial credit):
Mirror Mirror on the Ball (40 pts)
In this problem we will investigate the physics of spherical mirrors. In geometric optics,
there are neat equations governing the position and size of images in curved mirrors. However,
the equations we will explore in this problem are mere approximations, and real objects with
finite size will appear slightly different and distorted than the equations suggest. This may be
considered as a result of spherical aberration, where images appear distorted due to the imperfect
geometric properties spherical surfaces posess regarding reflection. Assume paraaxial rays (rays
travelling at a small angle from the center axis) for all parts of this problem. Angles in diagrams
are greatly exaggerated for clarity.
a.
Consider a spherical mirror with its center on the x-axis. A ray of light travels at an angle
from the x-axis, hits the mirror, and reflects. The radius connecting the center of the
Œ±
circle to the point the light hit forms an angle
with the x-axis. Find the angle
that the
Œ≥
Œ≤
reflected ray forms with the x-axis. Express your answer in terms of
and . (3 pts)

Œ≥

b. If a point source produces many of these rays, an image will be formed inside the mirror.
The location of this image is located at the intersection of the x-axis and the ray gotten by
tracing the reflected ray found in part a backwards. The point source is located at a
distance
from the front surface, the image is located at a distance
behind the front

surface, and the mirror has a radius . Using small angle approximation for all three
ùëü
angles, show that the following equation holds:

c.
Instead of a point source, put a ring of radius
centered at the same spot, with its center
‚Ñé
axis aligned with the x-axis. If the traditional equations are used for spherical mirrors,
one can find the radius of the resulting image by applying similar triangles. By using this
method, find the image radius

d. In reality, the image radius and position is slightly different. This is because in the part c
we approximated the ring as a point source, and geometrically extended the argument to
find its size. What actually happens is that each point on the ring is a point source, and
the image for each point can be found via the method in part b. Using this new method,
find the x-position
of the image. Express your answer in terms of
