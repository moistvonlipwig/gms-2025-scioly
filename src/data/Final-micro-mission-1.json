        {
          "question": "Explain the role of microbes in nitrogen fixation.",
          "answer": "Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium, convert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into ammonia (NH₃), which can be used by plants. This process enriches soil fertility and supports plant growth."

        {
          "question": "Describe the difference between lytic and lysogenic viral life cycles.",
          "answer": "In the lytic cycle, a virus replicates rapidly, lysing the host cell to release new virions. In the lysogenic cycle, viral DNA integrates into the host genome and replicates with it until environmental factors trigger the lytic phase."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the four stages of bacterial growth in a closed culture system?",
          "answer": "Lag phase (cells adapt), Log phase (exponential growth), Stationary phase (growth slows due to limited resources), Death phase (cells die due to nutrient depletion and waste accumulation)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the Gram stain differentiate between bacterial cell types?",
          "answer": "Gram-positive bacteria retain crystal violet due to their thick peptidoglycan layer, appearing purple. Gram-negative bacteria lose the stain and take up safranin, appearing pink due to their thin peptidoglycan and outer membrane."
        },
        {
          "question": "Describe two key structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.",
          "answer": "Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus, while eukaryotic cells contain a defined nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is an endospore, and why is it important?",
          "answer": "An endospore is a dormant, highly resistant bacterial structure that enables survival under harsh conditions such as heat, radiation, and chemicals."
        },
        {
          "question": "Describe the function of a bacterial flagellum.",
          "answer": "A flagellum is a whip-like structure used for motility, allowing bacteria to move toward favorable environments or away from harmful stimuli."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the significance of biofilms in microbial communities?",
          "answer": "Biofilms protect microbes from environmental stress, antibiotics, and immune responses by forming structured, surface-adhered communities."
        },
        {
          "question": "Explain why viruses are not considered living organisms.",
          "answer": "Viruses lack cellular structures, cannot reproduce independently, and require a host cell to replicate, making them obligate intracellular parasites."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are Koch’s postulates, and how are they used in microbiology?",
          "answer": "Koch’s postulates establish a causal relationship between microbes and disease by isolating the suspected pathogen, culturing it, and infecting a healthy host to observe disease symptoms."
