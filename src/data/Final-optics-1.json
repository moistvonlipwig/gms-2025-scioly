      "points": 4,
      "questions": [
        {"question": "Explain the principle of total internal reflection and its applications.", "answer": "Total internal reflection occurs when light traveling in a denser medium hits the boundary with a less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle, causing it to reflect entirely back into the denser medium. Applications include fiber optics and binoculars."},
        {"question": "Describe how a concave mirror forms an image when an object is placed at its focal point.", "answer": "When an object is placed at the focal point of a concave mirror, the reflected rays become parallel and do not converge to form a real image. Instead, the image appears infinitely far away."},
        {"question": "Why does the sky appear blue during the day but red at sunset?", "answer": "The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering, where shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more than longer (red) wavelengths. At sunset, the light path through the atmosphere is longer, scattering more blue light out and allowing red and orange hues to dominate."},
        {"question": "Explain how the human eye focuses light on the retina.", "answer": "The cornea provides most of the eye’s refraction, while the lens fine-tunes the focus by changing shape (accommodation). The ciliary muscles contract or relax to adjust the lens curvature, ensuring light converges onto the retina."},
        {"question": "Describe the process of chromatic dispersion in a prism.", "answer": "Chromatic dispersion occurs when different wavelengths of light refract at different angles due to varying speeds in a medium. In a prism, shorter wavelengths (blue) bend more than longer wavelengths (red), creating a spectrum."}

        {"question": "A convex lens has a focal length of 20 cm. If an object is placed 50 cm from the lens, determine the image location and its characteristics.", "answer": "Using the lens equation, image distance = 33.3 cm, real and inverted."},
