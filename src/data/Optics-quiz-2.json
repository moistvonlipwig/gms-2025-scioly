      "type": "shortAnswer",
      "question": "Explain the difference between additive and subtractive color mixing.",
      "answer": "Additive color mixing combines light sources (red, green, blue) to make white. Subtractive mixing combines pigments (cyan, magenta, yellow) to absorb light and create black.",

      "type": "shortAnswer",
      "question": "If you shine a blue light on a yellow object, what color will the object appear and why?",
      "answer": "It will appear black or dark because yellow pigment absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light, but since the blue light source provides no red or green, no light is reflected.",

    {
      "type": "shortAnswer",
      "question": "Describe the pathway light follows from the cornea to the optic nerve.",
      "answer": "Light enters through the cornea, passes through the aqueous humor, pupil, lens, vitreous humor, and is focused onto the retina. The optic nerve then transmits signals to the brain.",
